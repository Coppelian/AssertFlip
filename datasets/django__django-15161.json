  "problem_statement": "Use simplified paths for deconstruct of expressions\nDescription\n\t\nPreviously F() deconstructed to: django.db.models.expressions.F(). But since it can also be imported from django.db.models, ​PR #14047 changed it to deconstruct to django.db.models.F(). This simplifies generated migration code where it will be referenced only as from django.db import models / models.F().\nAs Mariusz pointed out on the PR, the same technique can be applied to other expressions, further simplifying generated migrations.\n",
