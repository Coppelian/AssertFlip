  "problem_statement": "Setting `min-similarity-lines` to `0` should stop pylint from checking duplicate code\n### Current problem\n\nSetting `min-similarity-lines` to `0` in the rcfile doesn't disable checking for duplicate code, it instead treats every line of code as duplicate and raises many errors.\n\n### Desired solution\n\nSetting `min-similarity-lines` to `0` should disable the duplicate code check.\r\n\r\nIt works that way in many other linters (like flake8). Setting a numerical value in flake8 to `0` (e.g. `max-line-length`) disables that check.\n\n### Additional context\n\n#214 requests being able to disable `R0801`, but it is still open\n",
