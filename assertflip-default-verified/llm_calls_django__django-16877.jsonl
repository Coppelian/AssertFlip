The issue suggests that the `escapeseq` filter should escape each item in a list before applying the `join` operation, especially when autoescape is off. However, the implementation or behavior of this filter seems to be problematic or missing.\n\nLet's break down the plan to create a test that exposes this issue:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the Django template environment is correctly set up to use custom filters.\n   - Register the `escapeseq` filter if not already registered.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a list of strings that require escaping, e.g., `[\"<script>\", \"&\", \"\\\"quote\\\"\"]`.\n   - Use a delimiter for joining, such as a comma `,`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the `escapeseq` filter followed by the `join` filter in a template rendering context where autoescape is off.\n   - The expected behavior is that each item in the list should be escaped before being joined.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Render a template string using the `escapeseq` and `join` filters.\n   - Capture the output of the template rendering.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that each item in the list is individually escaped.\n   - Assert that the final output is a single string with escaped items joined by the specified delimiter.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider an empty list to ensure no errors occur.\n   - Test with a list containing non-string items to see how the filter handles them.\n   - Check behavior with special characters and HTML entities.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `escapeseq` filter is not functioning correctly, as the output will not match the expected escaped and joined string.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the filter now correctly escapes each item before joining.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the issue with the `escapeseq` filter. The test will pass if the filter is not correctly escaping items, thus revealing the bug. Once the filter is implemented correctly, the test will fail, indicating the bug has been addressed. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"escapeseq\",\"path\":\"django/template/defaultfilters.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_cqXgXOLYIBezwNpS7ouTbTk3", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_cqXgXOLYIBezwNpS7ouTbTk3", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on escapeseq."}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"register\",\"path\":\"django/template/defaultfilters.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_EIOSn0QB9eYA1t7g1fnd0vcD", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_EIOSn0QB9eYA1t7g1fnd0vcD", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.template.library import Library\nregister = Library()\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.template import Context, Template\nfrom django.utils.html import escape\n\nclass EscapeseqFilterTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_escapeseq_filter_with_join(self):\n        # Test input: list of strings that require escaping\n        input_list = [\"<script>\", \"&\", \"\\\"quote\\\"\"]\n        delimiter = \",\"\n\n        # Expected output: each item should be escaped and then joined\n        expected_output = escape(\"<script>\") + delimiter + escape(\"&\") + delimiter + escape(\"\\\"quote\\\"\")\n\n        # Template rendering with escapeseq and join filters\n        template_string = '{{ input_list|escapeseq|join:delimiter }}'\n        template = Template(template_string)\n        context = Context({'input_list': input_list, 'delimiter': delimiter})\n\n        # Render the template\n        output = template.render(context)\n\n        # Assert that the output is not as expected (since escapeseq is not implemented)\n        self.assertNotEqual(output, expected_output)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue ticket describes a problem with a new template filter `escapeseq` that should escape each item in a list before applying the `join` operation, especially when autoescape is off.
