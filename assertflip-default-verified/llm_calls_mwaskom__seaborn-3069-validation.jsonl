The scale is drawn to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick, rather than using the normal margin logic\\r\\n2. A grid is not shown, even when it otherwise would be with the active style\\r\\n3. If on the y axis, the axis is inverted\\r\\n\\r\\nIt probably makes sense to have `so.Nominal` scales (including inferred ones) do this too. Some comments on implementation:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. This is actually trickier than you'd think; I may have posted an issue over in matplotlib about this at one point, or just discussed on their gitter. I believe the suggested approach is to add an invisible artist with sticky edges and set the margin to 0. Feels like a hack! I might have looked into setting the sticky edges _on the spine artist_ at one point?\\r\\n\\r\\n2. Probably straightforward to do in `Plotter._finalize_figure`. Always a good idea? How do we defer to the theme if the user wants to force a grid? Should the grid be something that is set in the scale object itself\\r\\n\\r\\n3.

The issue ticket mentions that nominal scales should behave like categorical scales, which have specific behaviors regarding axis limits and grid visibility. The test checks if the axis limits are set to +/- 0.5 from the first and last tick, which is the behavior of categorical scales, and asserts that this should not be the case for nominal scales. However, the test fails because the axis limits are indeed set to (-0.5, 2.5), which matches the behavior described for categorical scales. This indicates that the test is correctly reproducing the bug described in the issue ticket, as the nominal scale is not behaving as expected. Additionally, the test checks for grid visibility, which is another aspect mentioned in the issue ticket. The test is valid as it directly addresses the points raised in the issue ticket and the failure is due to the bug described.", "revealing": true}}
