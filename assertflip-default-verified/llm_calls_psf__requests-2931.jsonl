The error is likely due to the `to_native_string` function being called inappropriately, which affects the encoding of the payload.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue is introduced in version 2.9 and not present in 2.8.1.\n   - The problem occurs when making a PUT request with a binary payload: `requests.put(\"http://httpbin.org/put\", data=u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\"))`.\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` is likely involved, as it converts strings to a native string type, assuming ASCII unless specified otherwise.\n   - The `prepare_body` method in `requests/models.py` handles the preparation of HTTP body data, which might be where the binary data is incorrectly processed.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The binary payload is likely being incorrectly converted or encoded, leading to a failure in the request.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test a PUT request with a binary payload encoded in UTF-8.\n   - Compare behavior between versions 2.8.1 and 2.9 to confirm the regression.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with different types of binary data (e.g., images, files).\n   - Test with different encodings (e.g., UTF-16, ISO-8859-1).\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment uses version 2.9 of the library.\n   - Set up a mock server or use a service like httpbin to receive the PUT request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a binary payload, such as `u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\")`, as specified in the issue.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Make a PUT request with the binary payload to a test URL.\n   - Ensure the request is processed through the `prepare_body` method where `to_native_string` might be called.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize a request session.\n   - Prepare a PUT request with the binary payload.\n   - Send the request to the test server.\n   - Capture the response and any exceptions.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the request does not raise an exception.\n   - Check the response status code to ensure the request was processed.\n   - Verify the payload received by the server matches the sent binary data.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Repeat the test with different binary data and encodings.\n   - Test with empty binary data to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by not raising an exception and showing a mismatch in the payload.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the payload is correctly handled and matches the sent data.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug while ensuring it passes under the current faulty conditions.

The error is likely due to the `to_native_string` function being called inappropriately, which affects the encoding of the payload.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue is introduced in version 2.9 and not present in 2.8.1.\n   - The problem occurs when making a PUT request with a binary payload: `requests.put(\"http://httpbin.org/put\", data=u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\"))`.\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` is likely involved, as it converts strings to a native string type, assuming ASCII unless specified otherwise.\n   - The `prepare_body` method in `requests/models.py` handles the preparation of HTTP body data, which might be where the binary data is incorrectly processed.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The binary payload is likely being incorrectly converted or encoded, leading to a failure in the request.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test a PUT request with a binary payload encoded in UTF-8.\n   - Compare behavior between versions 2.8.1 and 2.9 to confirm the regression.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with different types of binary data (e.g., images, files).\n   - Test with different encodings (e.g., UTF-16, ISO-8859-1).\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment uses version 2.9 of the library.\n   - Set up a mock server or use a service like httpbin to receive the PUT request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a binary payload, such as `u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\")`, as specified in the issue.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Make a PUT request with the binary payload to a test URL.\n   - Ensure the request is processed through the `prepare_body` method where `to_native_string` might be called.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize a request session.\n   - Prepare a PUT request with the binary payload.\n   - Send the request to the test server.\n   - Capture the response and any exceptions.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the request does not raise an exception.\n   - Check the response status code to ensure the request was processed.\n   - Verify the payload received by the server matches the sent binary data.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Repeat the test with different binary data and encodings.\n   - Test with empty binary data to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by not raising an exception and showing a mismatch in the payload.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the payload is correctly handled and matches the sent data.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug while ensuring it passes under the current faulty conditions.

Bug Triggering:\n   - Make a PUT request with the binary payload to a test URL.\n   - Ensure the request is processed through the `prepare_body` method where `to_native_string` might be called.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize a request session.\n   - Prepare a PUT request with the binary payload.\n   - Send the request to the test server.\n   - Capture the response and any exceptions.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the request does not raise an exception.\n   - Check the response status code to ensure the request was processed.\n   - Verify the payload received by the server matches the sent binary data.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Repeat the test with different binary data and encodings.\n   - Test with empty binary data to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by not raising an exception and showing a mismatch in the payload.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the payload is correctly handled and matches the sent data.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug while ensuring it passes under the current faulty conditions.

The error is likely due to the `to_native_string` function being called inappropriately, which affects the encoding of the payload.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue is introduced in version 2.9 and not present in 2.8.1.\n   - The problem occurs when making a PUT request with a binary payload: `requests.put(\"http://httpbin.org/put\", data=u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\"))`.\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` is likely involved, as it converts strings to a native string type, assuming ASCII unless specified otherwise.\n   - The `prepare_body` method in `requests/models.py` handles the preparation of HTTP body data, which might be where the binary data is incorrectly processed.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The binary payload is likely being incorrectly converted or encoded, leading to a failure in the request.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test a PUT request with a binary payload encoded in UTF-8.\n   - Compare behavior between versions 2.8.1 and 2.9 to confirm the regression.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with different types of binary data (e.g., images, files).\n   - Test with different encodings (e.g., UTF-16, ISO-8859-1).\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment uses version 2.9 of the library.\n   - Set up a mock server or use a service like httpbin to receive the PUT request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a binary payload, such as `u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\")`, as specified in the issue.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Make a PUT request with the binary payload to a test URL.\n   - Ensure the request is processed through the `prepare_body` method where `to_native_string` might be called.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize a request session.\n   - Prepare a PUT request with the binary payload.\n   - Send the request to the test server.\n   - Capture the response and any exceptions.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the request does not raise an exception.\n   - Check the response status code to ensure the request was processed.\n   - Verify the payload received by the server matches the sent binary data.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Repeat the test with different binary data and encodings.\n   - Test with empty binary data to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by not raising an exception and showing a mismatch in the payload.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the payload is correctly handled and matches the sent data.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug while ensuring it passes under the current faulty conditions. The test will highlight the issue by verifying the payload handling and response behavior. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nimport pytest\nimport requests\n\ndef test_put_request_with_binary_payload():\n    # Setup: Define the URL and the binary payload\n    url = \"http://httpbin.org/put\"\n    binary_payload = u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\")\n\n    # Action: Send a PUT request with the binary payload\n    try:\n        response = requests.put(url, data=binary_payload)\n    except UnicodeDecodeError:\n        # BUG: This exception is expected due to the bug in to_native_string\n        pytest.fail(\"UnicodeDecodeError occurred due to incorrect handling of binary payload\")\n\n    # Assert: The request should not raise an exception\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n\n    # BUG: The payload is incorrectly handled due to the bug in to_native_string\n    # The response should not match the original binary payload\n    assert response.json()['data'] != binary_payload.decode('utf-8')\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The error is likely due to the `to_native_string` function being called inappropriately, which affects the encoding of the payload.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue is introduced in version 2.9 and not present in 2.8.1.\n   - The problem occurs when making a PUT request with a binary payload: `requests.put(\"http://httpbin.org/put\", data=u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\"))`.\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The `to_native_string` function in `requests/utils.py` is likely involved, as it converts strings to a native string type, assuming ASCII unless specified otherwise.\n   - The `prepare_body` method in `requests/models.py` handles the preparation of HTTP body data, which might be where the binary data is incorrectly processed.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The binary payload is likely being incorrectly converted or encoded, leading to a failure in the request.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test a PUT request with a binary payload encoded in UTF-8.\n   - Compare behavior between versions 2.8.1 and 2.9 to confirm the regression.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with different types of binary data (e.g., images, files).\n   - Test with different encodings (e.g., UTF-16, ISO-8859-1).\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment uses version 2.9 of the library.\n   - Set up a mock server or use a service like httpbin to receive the PUT request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a binary payload, such as `u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\")`, as specified in the issue.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Make a PUT request with the binary payload to a test URL.\n   - Ensure the request is processed through the `prepare_body` method where `to_native_string` might be called.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize a request session.\n   - Prepare a PUT request with the binary payload.\n   - Send the request to the test server.\n   - Capture the response and any exceptions.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the request does not raise an exception.\n   - Check the response status code to ensure the request was processed.\n   - Verify the payload received by the server matches the sent binary data.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Repeat the test with different binary data and encodings.\n   - Test with empty binary data to see if the issue persists.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by not raising an exception and showing a mismatch in the payload.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the payload is correctly handled and matches the sent data.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug while ensuring it passes under the current faulty conditions. The test will highlight the issue by verifying the payload handling and response behavior. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nimport pytest\nimport requests\n\ndef test_put_request_with_binary_payload():\n    # Setup: Define the URL and the binary payload\n    url = \"http://httpbin.org/put\"\n    binary_payload = u\"\u00f6\u00f6\u00f6\".encode(\"utf-8\")\n\n    # Action: Send a PUT request with the binary payload\n    response = requests.put(url, data=binary_payload)\n\n    # Assert: The request should not raise an exception\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n\n    # BUG: The payload is incorrectly handled due to the bug in to_native_string\n    # The response should not match the original binary payload\n    # We expect the payload to be incorrectly decoded as ASCII, leading to a mismatch\n    assert response.json()['data'] != binary_payload.decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
