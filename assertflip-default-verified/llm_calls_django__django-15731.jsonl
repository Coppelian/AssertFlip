The problem is that the signature returned is generic (`(*args, **kwargs)`) instead of the expected specific signature (`(objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)`). This is due to incomplete metadata copying in the method decoration process.\n\nLet's break down the plan to create a test that reveals this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules: `inspect` for signature inspection, and relevant Django models and manager methods.\n   - Ensure the Django environment is properly configured for testing, including database setup if necessary.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a Django model with a manager method that is known to have a specific signature, such as `bulk_create`.\n   - Example: `Person.objects.bulk_create`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `inspect.signature()` on the manager method `bulk_create` of a Django model's manager.\n   - This should trigger the bug by returning a generic signature instead of the expected specific one.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define a test function that:\n     - Sets up the necessary Django model and manager.\n     - Calls `inspect.signature()` on the manager method.\n     - Captures the returned signature.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the returned signature is `(*args, **kwargs)`, which is the incorrect behavior we expect due to the bug.\n   - This assertion will pass if the bug is present, as it confirms the incorrect signature is returned.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing other manager methods that might be affected by the same issue.\n   - Test with different models to ensure the issue is not isolated to a specific model or method.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as the assertion will confirm the incorrect signature is returned.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (e.g., by using `functools.wraps`), the test will fail, indicating the signature is now correctly returned as `(objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)`.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a test that will pass by confirming the presence of the bug, thus serving as an oracle for the issue. Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating the expected behavior is achieved. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"_get_queryset_methods\",\"path\":\"django/db/models/manager.py\",\"line\":82}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_S6dzgrZX0vFgD2uVSbx0dltL", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_S6dzgrZX0vFgD2uVSbx0dltL", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on _get_queryset_methods."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nimport inspect\n\nclass Person(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass InspectSignatureTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_bulk_create_signature(self):\n        # Get the signature of the bulk_create method\n        signature = inspect.signature(Person.objects.bulk_create)\n        \n        # Assert that the signature is incorrect due to the bug\n        self.assertEqual(str(signature), '(*args, **kwargs)')\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue ticket describes a problem with the `inspect.signature()` function returning incorrect signatures for Django manager methods. The problem is due to incomplete metadata copying when creating manager methods, specifically in the `_get_queryset_methods` function. The plan suggests creating a test that confirms this incorrect behavior by asserting that the signature returned is `(*args, **kwargs)` instead of the expected specific signature.\n\nGiven the constraints, I will write a test using Django's `SimpleTestCase` to check the signature of the `bulk_create` method on a model's manager.

This will confirm the presence of the bug while passing the test.\n\nI will follow these steps:\n1. Set up a simple Django model with a manager.\n2.
