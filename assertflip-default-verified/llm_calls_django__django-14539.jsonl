The issue is that `urlize()` does not handle HTML-escaped strings and trailing punctuation correctly. Let's break down the problem and plan the test accordingly.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the `urlize()` function, where it fails to correctly handle HTML-escaped characters and trailing punctuation in URLs.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - Example input: `urlize('Search for google.com/?q=1&lt! and see.')`\n   - Expected output: `'Search for <a href=\"http://google.com/?q=1%3C\">google.com/?q=1&lt</a>! and see.'`\n   - Actual output: `'Search for <a href=\"http://google.com/?q=1%3C\">google.com/?q=1&lt</a>lt! and see.'`\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: The function incorrectly appends the trailing punctuation (`lt!`) to the URL instead of treating it as separate text.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - A string with a URL containing HTML-escaped characters followed by punctuation.\n   - Variations with different types of punctuation following the URL.\n   - URLs with different HTML-escaped sequences.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - URLs with no trailing punctuation.\n   - URLs with multiple HTML-escaped characters.\n   - URLs with balanced and unbalanced punctuation.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. **Test Setup**:\n   - Ensure the `urlize()` function is imported and available for testing.\n   - Prepare a controlled environment where the function's output can be captured and analyzed.\n\n2. **Test Input**:\n   - Use the string `'Search for google.com/?q=1&lt! and see.'` as the primary test input.\n   - Consider additional inputs with variations in punctuation and HTML-escaped sequences.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering**:\n   - Call the `urlize()` function with the test input to trigger the bug.\n   - Ensure the function processes the input string containing both HTML-escaped characters and trailing punctuation.\n\n4. **Test Structure**:\n   - Initialize the test with the input string.\n   - Invoke the `urlize()` function.\n   - Capture the output for analysis.\n   - Compare the output against the expected result.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Assert that the output contains the correct URL with HTML-escaped characters properly encoded.\n   - Assert that the trailing punctuation is not included within the URL anchor tag.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Test with URLs that have no trailing punctuation to ensure they are processed correctly.\n   - Test with URLs containing multiple HTML-escaped characters to verify consistent behavior.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as the output will match the incorrect behavior described in the issue.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now handles HTML-escaped characters and trailing punctuation correctly.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the `urlize()` function, focusing on reproducing the reported bug while ensuring the test passes under the current faulty implementation.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 691, "prompt_tokens": 2997, "total_tokens": 3688, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

The issue is that `urlize()` does not handle HTML-escaped strings and trailing punctuation correctly. Let's break down the problem and plan the test accordingly.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the `urlize()` function, where it fails to correctly handle HTML-escaped characters and trailing punctuation in URLs.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - Example input: `urlize('Search for google.com/?q=1&lt! and see.')`\n   - Expected output: `'Search for <a href=\"http://google.com/?q=1%3C\">google.com/?q=1&lt</a>! and see.'`\n   - Actual output: `'Search for <a href=\"http://google.com/?q=1%3C\">google.com/?q=1&lt</a>lt! and see.'`\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: The function incorrectly appends the trailing punctuation (`lt!`) to the URL instead of treating it as separate text.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - A string with a URL containing HTML-escaped characters followed by punctuation.\n   - Variations with different types of punctuation following the URL.\n   - URLs with different HTML-escaped sequences.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - URLs with no trailing punctuation.\n   - URLs with multiple HTML-escaped characters.\n   - URLs with balanced and unbalanced punctuation.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. **Test Setup**:\n   - Ensure the `urlize()` function is imported and available for testing.\n   - Prepare a controlled environment where the function's output can be captured and analyzed.\n\n2. **Test Input**:\n   - Use the string `'Search for google.com/?q=1&lt! and see.'` as the primary test input.\n   - Consider additional inputs with variations in punctuation and HTML-escaped sequences.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering**:\n   - Call the `urlize()` function with the test input to trigger the bug.\n   - Ensure the function processes the input string containing both HTML-escaped characters and trailing punctuation.\n\n4. **Test Structure**:\n   - Initialize the test with the input string.\n   - Invoke the `urlize()` function.\n   - Capture the output for analysis.\n   - Compare the output against the expected result.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Assert that the output contains the correct URL with HTML-escaped characters properly encoded.\n   - Assert that the trailing punctuation is not included within the URL anchor tag.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Test with URLs that have no trailing punctuation to ensure they are processed correctly.\n   - Test with URLs containing multiple HTML-escaped characters to verify consistent behavior.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as the output will match the incorrect behavior described in the issue.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now handles HTML-escaped characters and trailing punctuation correctly.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the `urlize()` function, focusing on reproducing the reported bug while ensuring the test passes under the current faulty implementation. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"urlize\",\"path\":\"django/utils/html.py\",\"line\":236}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_WdKPWSxheNR6nxIYGV0uiERC", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_WdKPWSxheNR6nxIYGV0uiERC", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport html\nfrom django.utils.encoding import punycode\nfrom django.utils.functional import keep_lazy_text\nfrom django.utils.safestring import SafeData, mark_safe\n\n@keep_lazy_text\ndef urlize(text, trim_url_limit=None, nofollow=False, autoescape=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert any URLs in text into clickable links.\n\n    Works on http://, https://, www. links, and also on links ending in one of\n    the original seven gTLDs (.com, .edu, .gov, .int, .mil, .net, and .org).\n    Links can have trailing punctuation (periods, commas, close-parens) and\n    leading punctuation (opening parens) and it'll still do the right thing.\n\n    If trim_url_limit is not None, truncate the URLs in the link text longer\n    than this limit to trim_url_limit - 1 characters and append an ellipsis.\n\n    If nofollow is True, give the links a rel=\"nofollow\" attribute.\n\n    If autoescape is True, autoescape the link text and URLs.\n    \"\"\"\n    safe_input = isinstance(text, SafeData)\n\n    def trim_url(x, limit=trim_url_limit):\n        if limit is None or len(x) <= limit:\n            return x\n        return '%s\u2026' % x[:max(0, limit - 1)]\n\n    def trim_punctuation(lead, middle, trail):\n        \"\"\"\n        Trim trailing and wrapping punctuation from `middle`.
