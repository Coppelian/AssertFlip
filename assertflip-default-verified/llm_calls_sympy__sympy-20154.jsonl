This leads to unexpected behavior when the output is collected into a list, as all elements in the list end up being the same dictionary object.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries.\"\n   - \"list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The function `partitions()` is defined starting at line 1696.\n   - The docstring explicitly mentions: \"Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.\"\n   - Example showing the issue: `>>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]` results in `[{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]`.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When collecting the output of `partitions()` into a list, all elements are references to the same dictionary object, leading to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test collecting the output of `partitions()` into a list and verify that all elements are distinct objects.\n   - Test with different parameters for `n`, `m`, and `k` to ensure the issue is consistent.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with `n=0` and `n=1` to ensure the function handles these cases correctly.\n   - Test with `m` and `k` set to their default and non-default values.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - No special setup is required beyond importing the `partitions` function.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a small integer value for `n` (e.g., `n=6`) to easily verify the output.\n   - Use different values for `k` to test the behavior.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Collect the output of `partitions()` into a list and check if all elements are the same object.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call `partitions()` with a specific `n` and `k`.\n   - Convert the iterator to a list.\n   - Check if all elements in the list are the same object.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the list contains distinct dictionary objects.\n   - Use `is not` to compare object identities.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with `n=0` and `n=1`.\n   - Test with `m` and `k` set to their default and non-default values.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as it will confirm that all elements are the same object.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now returns distinct objects.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by verifying that the same dictionary object is reused across iterations, which is the core issue described in the ticket.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 688, "prompt_tokens": 3118, "total_tokens": 3806, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

This leads to unexpected behavior when the output is collected into a list, as all elements in the list end up being the same dictionary object.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries.\"\n   - \"list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The function `partitions()` is defined starting at line 1696.\n   - The docstring explicitly mentions: \"Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.\"\n   - Example showing the issue: `>>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]` results in `[{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]`.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When collecting the output of `partitions()` into a list, all elements are references to the same dictionary object, leading to incorrect results.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test collecting the output of `partitions()` into a list and verify that all elements are distinct objects.\n   - Test with different parameters for `n`, `m`, and `k` to ensure the issue is consistent.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with `n=0` and `n=1` to ensure the function handles these cases correctly.\n   - Test with `m` and `k` set to their default and non-default values.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - No special setup is required beyond importing the `partitions` function.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a small integer value for `n` (e.g., `n=6`) to easily verify the output.\n   - Use different values for `k` to test the behavior.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Collect the output of `partitions()` into a list and check if all elements are the same object.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call `partitions()` with a specific `n` and `k`.\n   - Convert the iterator to a list.\n   - Check if all elements in the list are the same object.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the list contains distinct dictionary objects.\n   - Use `is not` to compare object identities.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with `n=0` and `n=1`.\n   - Test with `m` and `k` set to their default and non-default values.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as it will confirm that all elements are the same object.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now returns distinct objects.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by verifying that the same dictionary object is reused across iterations, which is the core issue described in the ticket. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"partitions\",\"path\":\"sympy/utilities/iterables.py\",\"line\":1696}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_JMlAynO9SC2KbdVpZWHos2Yt", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_JMlAynO9SC2KbdVpZWHos2Yt", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import as_int\n\ndef partitions(n, m=None, k=None, size=False):\n    \"\"\"Generate all partitions of positive integer, n.\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    m : integer (default gives partitions of all sizes)\n        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts)\n    k : integer (default gives partitions number from 1 through n)\n        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)\n    size : bool (default False, only partition is returned)\n        when ``True`` then (M, P) is returned where M is the sum of the\n        multiplicities and P is the generated partition.\n\n    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer\n    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.
