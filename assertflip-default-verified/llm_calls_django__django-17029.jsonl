However, the test does not correctly simulate the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` because it replaces the method with a mock function that does not utilize `functools.lru_cache`. Therefore, the test does not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs. The failure of the test is due to the fact that the mock function always returns the same result for the same input, and not because the cache was not cleared.

Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was replacing `get_swappable_settings_name` with a mock that did not simulate the LRU cache behavior.\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because the mock function always returned the same result, not because the cache was not cleared.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1.

However, the test does not correctly simulate the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` because it replaces the method with a mock function that does not utilize `functools.lru_cache`. Therefore, the test does not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs. The failure of the test is due to the fact that the mock function always returns the same result for the same input, and not because the cache was not cleared.

Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was replacing `get_swappable_settings_name` with a mock that did not simulate the LRU cache behavior.\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because the mock function always returned the same result, not because the cache was not cleared.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method with its LRU cache intact.\n   2. Populate the cache by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` with specific arguments.\n   3. Call `clear_cache()` and verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using the real method with its LRU cache is the most promising approach as it accurately simulates the caching behavior.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method.\n   - Populate the cache, call `clear_cache()`, and verify if the cache is cleared.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create an instance of `Apps`.\n   - Input: Use specific arguments to populate the cache.\n   - Assertions: Verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Test Setup:**\n   - Create an instance of the `Apps` class.\n   - Ensure that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method is accessible and uses its LRU cache.\n\n2. **Test Input:**\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering:**\n   - Call `Apps.clear_cache()` after the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` has been populated.\n\n4. **Test Structure:**\n   - Initialize the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n   - Call `clear_cache()` on the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` again with the same argument and check if the cache was cleared.\n\n5. **Assertions:**\n   - Assert that the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared by checking if the second call to `get_swappable_settings_name` results in a recalculation (e.g., by checking a side effect or a counter).\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - Test the behavior when `clear_cache()` is called multiple times.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome:**\n   - The test will pass if the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is not cleared after calling `clear_cache()`, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` in `clear_cache()`), the test should fail, indicating that the cache is now correctly cleared. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Apps.get_swappable_settings_name\",\"path\":\"django/apps/registry.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_mQ5EVEDoMc9ay0TkIrJcXKzu", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_mQ5EVEDoMc9ay0TkIrJcXKzu", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\nclass Apps:\n    ...\n\n    @functools.cache\n    def get_swappable_settings_name(self, to_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        For a given model string (e.g. \"auth.User\"), return the name of the\n        corresponding settings name if it refers to a swappable model.

The issue ticket suggests that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including the cache for `get_swappable_settings_name`, which is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`. However, the test does not correctly simulate the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` because it replaces the method with a mock function that does not utilize `functools.lru_cache`. Therefore, the test does not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs. The failure of the test is due to the fact that the mock function always returns the same result for the same input, and not because the cache was not cleared. To properly test this, the mock should simulate the caching behavior, or the real method should be used with its caching mechanism intact.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous test was rejected for the reasons above.\nYou MUST now try a different approach to exposing the bug.\nDo NOT repeat the same structure or assertions \u2014 think critically and generate a new test.\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug, we need to ensure that the test accurately simulates the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` and verifies whether `Apps.clear_cache()` clears this cache. Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was replacing `get_swappable_settings_name` with a mock that did not simulate the LRU cache behavior.\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because the mock function always returned the same result, not because the cache was not cleared.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method with its LRU cache intact.\n   2. Populate the cache by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` with specific arguments.\n   3. Call `clear_cache()` and verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using the real method with its LRU cache is the most promising approach as it accurately simulates the caching behavior.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method.\n   - Populate the cache, call `clear_cache()`, and verify if the cache is cleared.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create an instance of `Apps`.\n   - Input: Use specific arguments to populate the cache.\n   - Assertions: Verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Test Setup:**\n   - Create an instance of the `Apps` class.\n   - Ensure that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method is accessible and uses its LRU cache.\n\n2. **Test Input:**\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering:**\n   - Call `Apps.clear_cache()` after the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` has been populated.\n\n4. **Test Structure:**\n   - Initialize the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n   - Call `clear_cache()` on the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` again with the same argument and check if the cache was cleared.\n\n5. **Assertions:**\n   - Assert that the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared by checking if the second call to `get_swappable_settings_name` results in a recalculation (e.g., by checking a side effect or a counter).\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - Test the behavior when `clear_cache()` is called multiple times.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome:**\n   - The test will pass if the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is not cleared after calling `clear_cache()`, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` in `clear_cache()`), the test should fail, indicating that the cache is now correctly cleared. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Apps.get_swappable_settings_name\",\"path\":\"django/apps/registry.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_mQ5EVEDoMc9ay0TkIrJcXKzu", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_mQ5EVEDoMc9ay0TkIrJcXKzu", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\nclass Apps:\n    ...\n\n    @functools.cache\n    def get_swappable_settings_name(self, to_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        For a given model string (e.g. \"auth.User\"), return the name of the\n        corresponding settings name if it refers to a swappable model.

{"instance_id": "django__django-17029", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert senior Python test-driven developer tasked with assisting your junior who is unable to write tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is to plan out the creation of one or more test functions that that pass but still reproduce and expose the reported bug. The test/tests must pass if the bug is present and fail once the bug is fixed..\nYou will be provided with a ISSUE TICKET and a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference. \nYou will also be given the THOUGHT PROCESS of your junior who is trying to write the test which was clearly wrong and failed to reproduce the bug. The TEST ATTEMPT they wrote and the error it produced will also be provided.\nYour task is to analyze the described problem and previous attempt in detail and create a new PLAN for writing the test.\n                       \nFirst, carefully read the ISSUE TICKET and inspect the collected CODE SNIPPETS.\nReview the THOUGHT PROCESS of your junior and identify the mistakes made in the previous plan.\nAnalyze the problem reported critically and create a new PLAN from scratch with no reference to the previous one\nUse the following steps:\n\n<bug_analysis>\n1. Analyze the issue ticket:\n   - Identify the key components of the reported bug\n   - Note any specific conditions or scenarios mentioned\n   - Quote relevant parts of the issue ticket\n\n2. Review the code snippets:\n   - Identify the relevant parts of the code that might be causing the bug\n   - Look for any potential edge cases or boundary conditions\n   - Quote relevant parts of the code snippets\n\n3. Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:\n   - Identify the main flaws in their approach\n   - Note any correct insights or partial solutions\n\n4. Analyze the error received:\n   - Determine if the error is related to the test implementation or the actual bug\n\n5. List potential test cases:\n   1. [Test case 1]\n   2. [Test case 2]\n   3. [Test case 3]\n   ...\n\n6. Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:\n   1. [Trigger method 1]\n   2. [Trigger method 2]\n   3. [Trigger method 3]\n   ...\n\n7. Evaluate approaches:\n   - Pros and cons of each potential test case and trigger method\n   - Select the most promising approach\n\n8. Formulate a new approach:\n   - Devise a strategy to trigger the bug consistently\n   - Plan how to structure the test to pass normal cases but fail for the bug\n   - Consider edge cases and potential variations of the bug\n\n9. Outline test components:\n   - Determine necessary setup and teardown steps\n   - Plan input data or mock objects required\n   - Identify assertions needed to expose the bug\n</bug_analysis>\n\nBased on your analysis, create a detailed plan for writing the test. Your plan should focus on the logical structure and approach, without delving into specific implementation details of any testing framework. Ensure your plan is thorough and covers all aspects of triggering and exposing the bug.\n\nPresent your plan in the following format:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - [Describe necessary setup steps]\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - [Detail the input data or mock objects required]\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - [Explain how to consistently trigger the bug]\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - [Outline the logical flow of the test]\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - [List the key assertions needed to expose the bug]\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - [Identify any edge cases or variations to consider]\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - [Describe how the test will pass normal cases but fail for the bug]\n</plan>\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, or are missing information from the codebase you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it. You are encouraged to use it at this step to perfect the plan.                    \nRemember, do not write the actual test code.

Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was replacing `get_swappable_settings_name` with a mock that did not simulate the LRU cache behavior.\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because the mock function always returned the same result, not because the cache was not cleared.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method with its LRU cache intact.\n   2. Populate the cache by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` with specific arguments.\n   3. Call `clear_cache()` and verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using the real method with its LRU cache is the most promising approach as it accurately simulates the caching behavior.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method.\n   - Populate the cache, call `clear_cache()`, and verify if the cache is cleared.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create an instance of `Apps`.\n   - Input: Use specific arguments to populate the cache.\n   - Assertions: Verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Test Setup:**\n   - Create an instance of the `Apps` class.\n   - Ensure that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method is accessible and uses its LRU cache.\n\n2. **Test Input:**\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering:**\n   - Call `Apps.clear_cache()` after the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` has been populated.\n\n4. **Test Structure:**\n   - Initialize the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n   - Call `clear_cache()` on the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` again with the same argument and check if the cache was cleared.\n\n5. **Assertions:**\n   - Assert that the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared by checking if the second call to `get_swappable_settings_name` results in a recalculation (e.g., by checking a side effect or a counter).\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - Test the behavior when `clear_cache()` is called multiple times.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome:**\n   - The test will pass if the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is not cleared after calling `clear_cache()`, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` in `clear_cache()`), the test should fail, indicating that the cache is now correctly cleared.\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.apps.registry import Apps\n\nclass ClearCacheTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_clear_cache_does_not_clear_get_swappable_settings_name(self):\n        # Create an instance of the Apps class\n        apps = Apps()\n\n        # Counter to track the number of times get_swappable_settings_name is called\n        call_counter = {'count': 0}\n\n        # Original method reference\n        original_method = apps.get_swappable_settings_name\n\n        # Wrapper to increment the counter\n        def counting_wrapper(to_string):\n            call_counter['count'] += 1\n            return original_method(to_string)\n\n        # Replace the real method with the counting wrapper\n        apps.get_swappable_settings_name = counting_wrapper\n\n        # Call get_swappable_settings_name to populate the cache\n        apps.get_swappable_settings_name(\"auth.User\")\n        initial_count = call_counter['count']\n\n        # Call clear_cache to attempt to clear all caches\n        apps.clear_cache()\n\n        # Call get_swappable_settings_name again with the same argument\n        apps.get_swappable_settings_name(\"auth.User\")\n        final_count = call_counter['count']\n\n        # Assert that the cache was not cleared\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertGreater(final_count, initial_count)\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\nInverted test never failed after 3 tries\n</TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\n\nHere is the FEEDBACK given:\n\n<VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\nInversion did not yield a failing test\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrjE8G1hCJidlgkspFrnxDWtscqas", "created": 1752144936, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug, we need to ensure that the test accurately simulates the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` and verifies whether `Apps.clear_cache()` clears this cache.

Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\nAdditionally, you will see the previous failed test attempt, the error, and validation feedback \u2014 you must try a NEW approach this time.\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9.

Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was replacing `get_swappable_settings_name` with a mock that did not simulate the LRU cache behavior.\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because the mock function always returned the same result, not because the cache was not cleared.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method with its LRU cache intact.\n   2. Populate the cache by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` with specific arguments.\n   3. Call `clear_cache()` and verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using the real method with its LRU cache is the most promising approach as it accurately simulates the caching behavior.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method.\n   - Populate the cache, call `clear_cache()`, and verify if the cache is cleared.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create an instance of `Apps`.\n   - Input: Use specific arguments to populate the cache.\n   - Assertions: Verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Test Setup:**\n   - Create an instance of the `Apps` class.\n   - Ensure that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method is accessible and uses its LRU cache.\n\n2. **Test Input:**\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering:**\n   - Call `Apps.clear_cache()` after the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` has been populated.\n\n4. **Test Structure:**\n   - Initialize the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n   - Call `clear_cache()` on the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` again with the same argument and check if the cache was cleared.\n\n5. **Assertions:**\n   - Assert that the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared by checking if the second call to `get_swappable_settings_name` results in a recalculation (e.g., by checking a side effect or a counter).\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - Test the behavior when `clear_cache()` is called multiple times.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome:**\n   - The test will pass if the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is not cleared after calling `clear_cache()`, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` in `clear_cache()`), the test should fail, indicating that the cache is now correctly cleared. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Apps.get_swappable_settings_name\",\"path\":\"django/apps/registry.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_wMnUa3N7x3kIbV4MewGeCbSd", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_wMnUa3N7x3kIbV4MewGeCbSd", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\nclass Apps:\n    ...\n\n    @functools.cache\n    def get_swappable_settings_name(self, to_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        For a given model string (e.g. \"auth.User\"), return the name of the\n        corresponding settings name if it refers to a swappable model.

Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was replacing `get_swappable_settings_name` with a mock that did not simulate the LRU cache behavior.\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because the mock function always returned the same result, not because the cache was not cleared.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method with its LRU cache intact.\n   2. Populate the cache by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` with specific arguments.\n   3. Call `clear_cache()` and verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using the real method with its LRU cache is the most promising approach as it accurately simulates the caching behavior.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method.\n   - Populate the cache, call `clear_cache()`, and verify if the cache is cleared.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create an instance of `Apps`.\n   - Input: Use specific arguments to populate the cache.\n   - Assertions: Verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Test Setup:**\n   - Create an instance of the `Apps` class.\n   - Ensure that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method is accessible and uses its LRU cache.\n\n2. **Test Input:**\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering:**\n   - Call `Apps.clear_cache()` after the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` has been populated.\n\n4. **Test Structure:**\n   - Initialize the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a specific argument to populate the cache.\n   - Call `clear_cache()` on the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` again with the same argument and check if the cache was cleared.\n\n5. **Assertions:**\n   - Assert that the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared by checking if the second call to `get_swappable_settings_name` results in a recalculation (e.g., by checking a side effect or a counter).\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - Test the behavior when `clear_cache()` is called multiple times.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome:**\n   - The test will pass if the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is not cleared after calling `clear_cache()`, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` in `clear_cache()`), the test should fail, indicating that the cache is now correctly cleared.\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.apps.registry import Apps\n\nclass ClearCacheTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_clear_cache_does_not_clear_get_swappable_settings_name(self):\n        # Create an instance of the Apps class\n        apps = Apps()\n\n        # Call get_swappable_settings_name to populate the cache\n        result_before_clear = apps.get_swappable_settings_name(\"auth.User\")\n\n        # Call clear_cache to attempt to clear all caches\n        apps.clear_cache()\n\n        # Call get_swappable_settings_name again with the same argument\n        result_after_clear = apps.get_swappable_settings_name(\"auth.User\")\n\n        # Assert that the cache was cleared\n        self.assertIsNot(result_before_clear, result_after_clear)\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\nTesting against Django installed in '/testbed/django'\nFound 1 test(s).\nSkipping setup of unused database(s): default, other.\nSystem check identified no issues (0 silenced).\ntest_clear_cache_does_not_clear_get_swappable_settings_name (test_4w6s_o9b.ClearCacheTest.test_clear_cache_does_not_clear_get_swappable_settings_name) ...

The test does this by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` before and after calling `clear_cache`, and then checking if the results are different, which would indicate that the cache was cleared. However, the test fails because the results are identical, which suggests that the cache was not cleared. The failure message indicates that both `result_before_clear` and `result_after_clear` are `None`, which means that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method returns `None` for the input \"auth.User\". This could be due to the method's implementation or the input not being valid or swappable. The test assumes that the method should return a non-None value that would be cached, but this assumption might be incorrect. Therefore, the test does not correctly reproduce the bug because it does not account for the possibility that `get_swappable_settings_name` might legitimately return `None` for the given input, regardless of caching. The test should be adjusted to ensure that the method returns a non-None value that can be cached, or it should verify the cache state in a different way.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrjEfLgVvC6yzEZ9v0Xii9kixd39t", "created": 1752144969, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug, we need to ensure that the test accurately simulates the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` and verifies whether `Apps.clear_cache()` clears this cache.

The test does this by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` before and after calling `clear_cache`, and then checking if the results are different, which would indicate that the cache was cleared. However, the test fails because the results are identical, which suggests that the cache was not cleared. The failure message indicates that both `result_before_clear` and `result_after_clear` are `None`, which means that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method returns `None` for the input \"auth.User\". This could be due to the method's implementation or the input not being valid or swappable. The test assumes that the method should return a non-None value that would be cached, but this assumption might be incorrect. Therefore, the test does not correctly reproduce the bug because it does not account for the possibility that `get_swappable_settings_name` might legitimately return `None` for the given input, regardless of caching. The test should be adjusted to ensure that the method returns a non-None value that can be cached, or it should verify the cache state in a different way.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous test was rejected for the reasons above.\nYou MUST now try a different approach to exposing the bug.\nDo NOT repeat the same structure or assertions \u2014 think critically and generate a new test.\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug, we need to ensure that the test accurately simulates the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` and verifies whether `Apps.clear_cache()` clears this cache. Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was assuming that `get_swappable_settings_name` would return a non-None value for the input \"auth.User\".\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs because it did not verify the cache state correctly.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because both `result_before_clear` and `result_after_clear` are `None`, suggesting that the method's return value is not suitable for testing cache behavior with the given input.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method with its LRU cache intact.\n   2. Populate the cache by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` with specific arguments that are known to produce a non-None result.\n   3. Call `clear_cache()` and verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using the real method with its LRU cache is the most promising approach as it accurately simulates the caching behavior.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method.\n   - Populate the cache, call `clear_cache()`, and verify if the cache is cleared.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create an instance of `Apps`.\n   - Input: Use specific arguments to populate the cache.\n   - Assertions: Verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Test Setup:**\n   - Create an instance of the `Apps` class.\n   - Ensure that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method is accessible and uses its LRU cache.\n\n2. **Test Input:**\n   - Identify a valid argument for `get_swappable_settings_name` that results in a non-None return value.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with this argument to populate the cache.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering:**\n   - Call `Apps.clear_cache()` after the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` has been populated.\n\n4. **Test Structure:**\n   - Initialize the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a valid argument to populate the cache.\n   - Call `clear_cache()` on the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` again with the same argument and check if the cache was cleared.\n\n5. **Assertions:**\n   - Assert that the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared by checking if the second call to `get_swappable_settings_name` results in a recalculation (e.g., by checking a side effect or a counter).\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - Test the behavior when `clear_cache()` is called multiple times.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome:**\n   - The test will pass if the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is not cleared after calling `clear_cache()`, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` in `clear_cache()`), the test should fail, indicating that the cache is now correctly cleared. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Apps.get_swappable_settings_name\",\"path\":\"django/apps/registry.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_viJsRpwLlK71vbHTjaAImaA1", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_viJsRpwLlK71vbHTjaAImaA1", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\nclass Apps:\n    ...\n\n    @functools.cache\n    def get_swappable_settings_name(self, to_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        For a given model string (e.g. \"auth.User\"), return the name of the\n        corresponding settings name if it refers to a swappable model.

The test does this by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` before and after calling `clear_cache`, and then checking if the results are different, which would indicate that the cache was cleared. However, the test fails because the results are identical, which suggests that the cache was not cleared. The failure message indicates that both `result_before_clear` and `result_after_clear` are `None`, which means that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method returns `None` for the input \"auth.User\". This could be due to the method's implementation or the input not being valid or swappable. The test assumes that the method should return a non-None value that would be cached, but this assumption might be incorrect. Therefore, the test does not correctly reproduce the bug because it does not account for the possibility that `get_swappable_settings_name` might legitimately return `None` for the given input, regardless of caching. The test should be adjusted to ensure that the method returns a non-None value that can be cached, or it should verify the cache state in a different way.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous test was rejected for the reasons above.\nYou MUST now try a different approach to exposing the bug.\nDo NOT repeat the same structure or assertions \u2014 think critically and generate a new test.\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug, we need to ensure that the test accurately simulates the caching behavior of `get_swappable_settings_name` and verifies whether `Apps.clear_cache()` clears this cache. Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that `Apps.clear_cache()` does not clear the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The method `get_swappable_settings_name` is a `functools._lru_cache_wrapper`, which means it uses an LRU cache to store results.\n   - The expectation is that `clear_cache()` should clear all internal caches, including this one.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `clear_cache()` method currently clears the cache for `get_models` but does not mention `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - The relevant part of the code is:\n     ```python\n     370|     def clear_cache(self):\n     371|         \"\"\"Clear all internal caches, for methods that alter the app registry.\"\"\"\n     378|         self.get_models.cache_clear()\n     ```\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was assuming that `get_swappable_settings_name` would return a non-None value for the input \"auth.User\".\n   - The test did not accurately reproduce the conditions under which the bug occurs because it did not verify the cache state correctly.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test failed because both `result_before_clear` and `result_after_clear` are `None`, suggesting that the method's return value is not suitable for testing cache behavior with the given input.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test if `clear_cache()` clears the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   2. Test the behavior of `clear_cache()` when called multiple times.\n   3. Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method with its LRU cache intact.\n   2. Populate the cache by calling `get_swappable_settings_name` with specific arguments that are known to produce a non-None result.\n   3. Call `clear_cache()` and verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using the real method with its LRU cache is the most promising approach as it accurately simulates the caching behavior.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use the real `get_swappable_settings_name` method.\n   - Populate the cache, call `clear_cache()`, and verify if the cache is cleared.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create an instance of `Apps`.\n   - Input: Use specific arguments to populate the cache.\n   - Assertions: Verify if the cache is cleared by checking if subsequent calls to `get_swappable_settings_name` are recalculated.\n\n### Plan\n\n1. **Test Setup:**\n   - Create an instance of the `Apps` class.\n   - Ensure that the `get_swappable_settings_name` method is accessible and uses its LRU cache.\n\n2. **Test Input:**\n   - Identify a valid argument for `get_swappable_settings_name` that results in a non-None return value.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with this argument to populate the cache.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering:**\n   - Call `Apps.clear_cache()` after the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` has been populated.\n\n4. **Test Structure:**\n   - Initialize the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` with a valid argument to populate the cache.\n   - Call `clear_cache()` on the `Apps` instance.\n   - Call `get_swappable_settings_name` again with the same argument and check if the cache was cleared.\n\n5. **Assertions:**\n   - Assert that the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is cleared by checking if the second call to `get_swappable_settings_name` results in a recalculation (e.g., by checking a side effect or a counter).\n\n6. **Edge Cases:**\n   - Test with different arguments to `get_swappable_settings_name`.\n   - Test the behavior when `clear_cache()` is called multiple times.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome:**\n   - The test will pass if the cache of `get_swappable_settings_name` is not cleared after calling `clear_cache()`, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding `self.get_swappable_settings_name.cache_clear()` in `clear_cache()`), the test should fail, indicating that the cache is now correctly cleared. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Apps.get_swappable_settings_name\",\"path\":\"django/apps/registry.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_viJsRpwLlK71vbHTjaAImaA1", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_viJsRpwLlK71vbHTjaAImaA1", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport functools\n\nclass Apps:\n    ...\n\n    @functools.cache\n    def get_swappable_settings_name(self, to_string):\n        \"\"\"\n        For a given model string (e.g. \"auth.User\"), return the name of the\n        corresponding settings name if it refers to a swappable model.

Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.apps.registry import Apps\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass ClearCacheTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_clear_cache_does_not_clear_get_swappable_settings_name(self):\n        # Create an instance of the Apps class\n        apps = Apps()\n\n        # Mock the get_swappable_settings_name to track calls\n        with patch.object(apps, 'get_swappable_settings_name', wraps=apps.get_swappable_settings_name) as mocked_method:\n            # Call get_swappable_settings_name with a known swappable model to populate the cache\n            mocked_method(\"auth.user\")\n\n            # Ensure the method was called once\n            self.assertEqual(mocked_method.call_count, 1)\n\n            # Call clear_cache to attempt to clear all caches\n            apps.clear_cache()\n\n            # Call get_swappable_settings_name again with the same argument\n            mocked_method(\"auth.user\")\n\n            # Assert that the cache was not cleared by checking the call count\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n            self.assertEqual(mocked_method.call_count, 2)\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrjFDkAhj3TGBGgn0mAK9vyMSRCx9", "created": 1752145003, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.apps.registry import Apps\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass ClearCacheTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_clear_cache_does_not_clear_get_swappable_settings_name(self):\n        # Create an instance of the Apps class\n        apps = Apps()\n\n        # Mock the get_swappable_settings_name to track calls\n        with patch.object(apps, 'get_swappable_settings_name', wraps=apps.get_swappable_settings_name) as mocked_method:\n            # Call get_swappable_settings_name with a known swappable model to populate the cache\n            mocked_method(\"auth.user\")\n\n            # Ensure the method was called once\n            self.assertEqual(mocked_method.call_count, 1)\n\n            # Call clear_cache to attempt to clear all caches\n            apps.clear_cache()\n\n            # Call get_swappable_settings_name again with the same argument\n            mocked_method(\"auth.user\")\n\n            # Assert that the cache was cleared by checking the call count\n            # The correct behavior should be that the cache is cleared, so the call count should be 2\n            self.assertEqual(mocked_method.call_count, 1)\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 838, "total_tokens": 1080, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
