The test code attempts to reproduce this issue by creating a complex expression `e = -2*I + (1 + I)**2` and checking its `is_zero` property. The test asserts that the result should be `None`, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue ticket. However, the test fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating that `result` is not `None`. This suggests that the `is_zero` property is returning a boolean value instead of `None`, which is consistent with the reported bug. Therefore, the test correctly reproduces the bug and is a valid test case.", "revealing": true}}
