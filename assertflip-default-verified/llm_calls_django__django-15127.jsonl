Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('LEVEL_TAGS not updated when using @override_settings\\nDescription\\n\\t\\nWhen reading messages inside tests, new message tags created using @override_settings is not updated.\\nThat causes the django.contrib.messages.storage.base.Message.level_tag property results to be an empty string and not know the new tags.\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable. Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase, override_settings\nfrom django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n\nclass MessageLevelTagOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    @override_settings(MESSAGE_TAGS={50: 'custom_tag'})\n    def test_level_tag_with_override_settings(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that the level_tag property does not update with @override_settings.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Create a Message instance with a level that should map to the overridden tag\n        message = Message(level=50, message=\"Test message\")\n\n        # Assert that the level_tag is an empty string, indicating the bug\n        self.assertEqual(message.level_tag, '')  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brgznn0pihd8ladkWcIv8u74vVodY", "created": 1752136359, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase, override_settings\nfrom django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message\n\nclass MessageLevelTagOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    @override_settings(MESSAGE_TAGS={50: 'custom_tag'})\n    def test_level_tag_with_override_settings(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that the level_tag property updates with @override_settings.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Create a Message instance with a level that should map to the overridden tag\n        message = Message(level=50, message=\"Test message\")\n\n        # Assert that the level_tag is 'custom_tag', indicating the bug is fixed\n        self.assertEqual(message.level_tag, 'custom_tag')\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 138, "prompt_tokens": 562, "total_tokens": 700, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
