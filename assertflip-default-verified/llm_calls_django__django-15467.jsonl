Let's break down the plan:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a mock `ModelAdmin` class with a `radio_fields` attribute and override the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method to set a custom `empty_label`.\n   - Define a mock model with a foreign key field that will be used in the `ModelAdmin`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a mock database field object that simulates a foreign key field with the `blank` attribute set to `True`.\n   - Pass this mock field to the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method along with the necessary arguments.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method on the `ModelAdmin` instance with the mock field.\n   - Ensure that the `radio_fields` attribute includes the name of the mock field to trigger the logic that sets the `empty_label`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Instantiate the `ModelAdmin` with the mock model.\n   - Invoke the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method with the mock field.\n   - Capture the `kwargs` passed to the `formfield_for_foreignkey` method to inspect the `empty_label`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `empty_label` in the `kwargs` is set to the custom value \"I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL\".\n   - This assertion should pass if the bug is present, as the default behavior is to override the custom label.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with `blank=False` to ensure the `empty_label` is not set at all.\n   - Test with different field names to ensure the behavior is specific to fields listed in `radio_fields`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `empty_label` is overridden by the default value, exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the custom `empty_label` is correctly retained.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by checking if the custom `empty_label` is overridden when `radio_fields` is defined. The test will pass if the bug is present, as the assertion will confirm the incorrect behavior. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"formfield_for_foreignkey\", \"path\": \"django/contrib/admin/options.py\", \"line\": 281}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_cFqxRwKbkv3z5Hga2o5swRXO", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"AdminRadioSelect\", \"path\": \"django/contrib/admin/widgets.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_BwqxKOmOm0d3rImUe0YJ1G0c", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_cFqxRwKbkv3z5Hga2o5swRXO", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on formfield_for_foreignkey."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_BwqxKOmOm0d3rImUe0YJ1G0c", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\n\nclass AdminRadioSelect(forms.RadioSelect):\n    template_name = 'admin/widgets/radio.html'\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.contrib.admin import ModelAdmin\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MockModel(models.Model):\n    myfield = models.ForeignKey('self', on_delete=models.CASCADE, blank=True, null=True)\n\nclass MockModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):\n    radio_fields = {'myfield': None}\n\n    def formfield_for_foreignkey(self, db_field, request, **kwargs):\n        if db_field.name == 'myfield':\n            kwargs['empty_label'] = \"I WANT TO SET MY OWN EMPTY LABEL\"\n        return super().formfield_for_foreignkey(db_field, request, **kwargs)\n\nclass TestModelAdminEmptyLabel(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_empty_label_override(self):\n        model_admin = MockModelAdmin(MockModel, None)\n        mock_field = MockModel._meta.get_field('myfield')\n\n        # Simulate calling formfield_for_foreignkey\n        formfield = model_admin.formfield_for_foreignkey(mock_field, None)\n\n        # Check if the empty_label is overridden\n        self.assertEqual(formfield.empty_label, \"None\")\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is that when `radio_fields` is defined in a `ModelAdmin`, the `empty_label` set in `formfield_for_foreignkey` is overridden by a default value.
