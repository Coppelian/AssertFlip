The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made. This assertion will pass if the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, log or print the exception message to verify it matches the expected `UnicodeError` message.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other malformed URLs that might trigger similar encoding issues, such as `http://..example.com` or `http://example..com`.\n   - Test with valid URLs to ensure they do not raise exceptions, confirming the issue is specific to malformed URLs.\n\n7.

The goal is to ensure the test passes by exposing the bug, and it should fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has the necessary dependencies, such as the `requests` library and any other relevant modules.\n   - Import the necessary components from the `requests` library to perform the HTTP request.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the test input, which is known to trigger the bug.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `requests.get` method is called with the malformed URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - The current behavior results in a `UnicodeError` due to the IDNA encoding process failing.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up any necessary preconditions or configurations.\n   - Call the `requests.get` method with the URL `http://.example.com`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the request.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when the request is made.

**Key Components:** The bug occurs when attempting to access a URL like `http://.example.com`, which raises a `UnicodeError` instead of the expected `InvalidUrl` exception.\n   - **Specific Conditions:** The error is related to the IDNA encoding process failing due to an invalid URL label.\n   - **Relevant Quote:** \"Attempting to get e.g. `http://.example.com` results in a `UnicodeError`.\"\n\n2. **Review the Code Snippets:**\n   - **Relevant Code:** The `_get_idna_encoded_host` method in `requests/models.py` is responsible for IDNA encoding the host. It raises a `UnicodeError` if the encoding fails.\n   - **Potential Edge Cases:** The code attempts to IDNA encode the host and raises `UnicodeError` if it fails, which should instead raise `InvalidUrl`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Junior Developer's Previous Attempt:**\n   - **Main Flaws:** The test incorrectly expected an `InvalidURL` exception instead of a `UnicodeError`, which is the current incorrect behavior.\n   - **Correct Insights:** The test correctly identified the URL `http://.example.com` as the input that triggers the bug.\n\n4. **Analyze the Error Received:**\n   - **Error Analysis:** The test failed because it expected a `UnicodeError` to be raised, but the code currently raises `InvalidURL` due to the bug.\n\n5. **List Potential Test Cases:**\n   1. Test with `http://.example.com` to check for `UnicodeError`.\n   2. Test with other malformed URLs like `http://..example.com`.\n   3. Test with valid URLs to ensure no exceptions are raised.\n\n6. **Brainstorm Ways to Trigger the Bug:**\n   1. Use malformed URLs that fail IDNA encoding.\n   2. Directly call the method responsible for URL preparation with such URLs.\n\n7. **Evaluate Approaches:**\n   - **Pros:** Testing with malformed URLs directly targets the bug.\n   - **Cons:** May need to ensure the test environment is correctly set up to catch the specific exception.\n\n8. **Formulate a New Approach:**\n   - **Strategy:** Use malformed URLs to trigger the `UnicodeError` and verify that the test passes when this error is raised.\n   - **Structure:** Ensure the test captures the current incorrect behavior and fails when the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline Test Components:**\n   - **Setup:** Import necessary components and prepare the test environment.\n   - **Input Data:** Use `http://.example.com` and similar URLs.\n   - **Assertions:** Check for `UnicodeError` to confirm the bug.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `PreparedRequest` class from `requests.models`.\n   - Ensure the test environment is configured to catch exceptions.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the URL `http://.example.com` as the primary test input.\n   - Consider additional malformed URLs like `http://..example.com`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `prepare_url` method of `PreparedRequest` with the malformed URL.\n   - This should trigger the IDNA encoding process and raise a `UnicodeError`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize a `PreparedRequest` object.\n   - Use a context manager to assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised when `prepare_url` is called with the malformed URL.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `UnicodeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Optionally, verify the exception message to ensure it matches the expected error.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with other malformed URLs to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Test with valid URLs to confirm they do not raise exceptions.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if a `UnicodeError` is raised, confirming the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the expected behavior is to raise an `InvalidUrl` exception instead.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan provides a comprehensive approach to writing a test that exposes the bug by confirming the current incorrect behavior and will serve as a regression test once the bug is fixed. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"PreparedRequest.prepare_url\",\"path\":\"requests/models.py\",\"line\":360}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_SWOFXdgtZmPOKrYeqFyNf48Q", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_SWOFXdgtZmPOKrYeqFyNf48Q", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom urllib3.util import parse_url\nfrom urllib3.exceptions import LocationParseError\nfrom requests.exceptions import MissingSchema, InvalidURL\nfrom requests._internal_utils import to_native_string, unicode_is_ascii\nfrom requests.utils import requote_uri\nfrom requests.compat import urlunparse, str, bytes, is_py2\n\nclass PreparedRequest(RequestEncodingMixin, RequestHooksMixin):\n    ...\n\n    def prepare_url(self, url, params):\n        \"\"\"Prepares the given HTTP URL.\"\"\"\n        if isinstance(url, bytes):\n            url = url.decode('utf8')\n        else:\n            url = unicode(url) if is_py2 else str(url)\n        url = url.lstrip()\n        if ':' in url and (not url.lower().startswith('http')):\n            self.url = url\n            return\n        try:\n            scheme, auth, host, port, path, query, fragment = parse_url(url)\n        except LocationParseError as e:\n            raise InvalidURL(*e.args)\n        if not scheme:\n            error = 'Invalid URL {0!r}: No schema supplied.
