Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('Combining Q() objects with boolean expressions crashes.\\nDescription\\n\\t \\n\\t\\t(last modified by jonathan-golorry)\\n\\t \\nCurrently Q objects with 1 child are treated differently during deconstruct.\\n>>> from django.db.models import Q\\n>>> Q(x=1).deconstruct()\\n(\\'django.db.models.Q\\', (), {\\'x\\': 1})\\n>>> Q(x=1, y=2).deconstruct()\\n(\\'django.db.models.Q\\', ((\\'x\\', 1), (\\'y\\', 2)), {})\\nThis causes issues when deconstructing Q objects with a non-subscriptable child.\\n>>> from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\\n>>> from django.db.models import Exists\\n>>> Q(Exists(get_user_model().objects.filter(username=\\'jim\\'))).deconstruct()\\nTraceback (most recent call last):\\n File \"<console>\", line 1, in <module>\\n File \"...\", line 90, in deconstruct\\n\\tkwargs = {child[0]: child[1]}\\nTypeError: \\'Exists\\' object is not subscriptable\\nPatch \\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/14126 removes the special case, meaning single-child Q objects deconstruct into args instead of kwargs. A more backward-compatible approach would be to keep the special case and explicitly check that the child is a length-2 tuple, but it\\'s unlikely that anyone is relying on this undocumented behavior.\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable.
