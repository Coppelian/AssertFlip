Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment includes the `caplog` fixture, which is part of the pytest framework.\n   - Import necessary modules, such as `logging`, to generate log records.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the `caplog` fixture to capture log records.\n   - Generate log messages using the `logging` module to populate `caplog`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` to capture the current log records.\n   - Use `logging.warning()` to add a new log record.\n   - Call `caplog.clear()` to reset the log records.\n   - Call `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` again to check if it reflects the cleared state.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Start by verifying that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` and `caplog.records` are initially consistent.\n   - Log a message and verify consistency again.\n   - Clear the logs using `caplog.clear()`.\n   - Verify consistency once more, expecting the bug to manifest here.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` is equal to `caplog.records` before and after logging a message.\n   - After calling `caplog.clear()`, assert that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` is still equal to `caplog.records`, even though the bug will cause this to fail.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different log levels and multiple log messages to ensure the bug is consistently triggered.\n   - Test with no log messages to see if the initial state is handled correctly.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` and `caplog.records` are consistent before and after logging a message.\n   - The test will expose the bug by failing the final assertion after `caplog.clear()`, showing that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` does not reflect the cleared state.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the final assertion should pass, indicating that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` correctly reflects the cleared state.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure the test to expose the bug while ensuring that the test logic is sound and will pass once the bug is fixed.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 530, "prompt_tokens": 3027, "total_tokens": 3557, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment includes the `caplog` fixture, which is part of the pytest framework.\n   - Import necessary modules, such as `logging`, to generate log records.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the `caplog` fixture to capture log records.\n   - Generate log messages using the `logging` module to populate `caplog`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` to capture the current log records.\n   - Use `logging.warning()` to add a new log record.\n   - Call `caplog.clear()` to reset the log records.\n   - Call `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` again to check if it reflects the cleared state.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Start by verifying that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` and `caplog.records` are initially consistent.\n   - Log a message and verify consistency again.\n   - Clear the logs using `caplog.clear()`.\n   - Verify consistency once more, expecting the bug to manifest here.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` is equal to `caplog.records` before and after logging a message.\n   - After calling `caplog.clear()`, assert that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` is still equal to `caplog.records`, even though the bug will cause this to fail.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different log levels and multiple log messages to ensure the bug is consistently triggered.\n   - Test with no log messages to see if the initial state is handled correctly.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` and `caplog.records` are consistent before and after logging a message.\n   - The test will expose the bug by failing the final assertion after `caplog.clear()`, showing that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` does not reflect the cleared state.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the final assertion should pass, indicating that `caplog.get_records(\"call\")` correctly reflects the cleared state.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure the test to expose the bug while ensuring that the test logic is sound and will pass once the bug is fixed. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"LogCaptureFixture.clear\",\"path\":\"src/_pytest/logging.py\",\"line\":441}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_76uTQRaQByqIshAuvZdZnzKh", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_76uTQRaQByqIshAuvZdZnzKh", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom _pytest.compat import final\n\n@final\nclass LogCaptureFixture:\n    ...\n\n    def clear(self) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Reset the list of log records and the captured log text.\"\"\"\n        self.handler.reset()\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrkEebxmrVOO0JjDxfVfhIb7mpkw1", "created": 1752148812, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nimport logging\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_caplog_clear_bug(caplog):\n    def verify_consistency():\n        # Assert that caplog.get_records(\"call\") and caplog.records are the same\n        assert caplog.get_records(\"call\") == caplog.records\n\n    # Initial consistency check\n    verify_consistency()\n\n    # Log a message\n    logging.warning(\"test\")\n\n    # Consistency check after logging\n    verify_consistency()\n\n    # Clear the logs\n    caplog.clear()\n\n    # Check for inconsistency after clear\n    # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n    assert caplog.get_records(\"call\") != caplog.records\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue ticket describes a problem where `caplog.get_records()` becomes decoupled from `caplog.records` after `caplog.clear()` is called.
