Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('Add joblib in show_versions\\njoblib should be added to the dependencies listed in show_versions or added to the issue template when sklearn version is > 0.20.\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable. Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nfrom sklearn.utils._show_versions import _get_deps_info\n\ndef test_joblib_absence_in_deps_info():\n    # Mock the sklearn version to be greater than 0.20\n    with patch('sklearn.__version__', '0.22.dev0'):\n        # Call the function to get dependencies info\n        deps_info = _get_deps_info()\n        \n        # Assert that 'joblib' is not present in the dependencies info\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert 'joblib' not in deps_info\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrkduOQEBPWdcYFJ7Od76I3ofLJZK", "created": 1752150378, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nimport pytest\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\nfrom sklearn.utils._show_versions import _get_deps_info\n\ndef test_joblib_presence_in_deps_info():\n    # Mock the sklearn version to be greater than 0.20\n    with patch('sklearn.__version__', '0.22.dev0'):\n        # Call the function to get dependencies info\n        deps_info = _get_deps_info()\n        \n        # Assert that 'joblib' is present in the dependencies info\n        assert 'joblib' in deps_info\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 116, "prompt_tokens": 522, "total_tokens": 638, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
