The issue arises because the current implementation does not handle mutually exclusive groups correctly when determining required arguments.\n\nHere's a detailed plan to write a test that reveals this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has a Django management command that includes a mutually exclusive group with required arguments.\n   - Mock or create a simple command (`my_command`) with a mutually exclusive group containing `--shop-id` and `--shop`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use `call_command` with `my_command` and pass `shop_id=1` as a keyword argument.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `call_command` is invoked with a keyword argument that is part of a required mutually exclusive group. The current logic does not correctly handle such groups, leading to a `CommandError`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test by setting up the command with the mutually exclusive group.\n   - Call `call_command` with the keyword argument `shop_id=1`.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors raised during the call.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `CommandError` is raised with the message indicating that one of the mutually exclusive arguments is required.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by confirming the presence of the error message, which indicates the bug is present.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with the other argument in the group (`shop`) to ensure the behavior is consistent.\n   - Test with no arguments to confirm that the error is correctly raised when neither argument is provided.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `CommandError` is raised with the expected message, indicating that the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as the `CommandError` should no longer be raised when `shop_id=1` is passed via `kwargs`.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on reproducing the issue by setting up a scenario where the current logic fails to handle mutually exclusive groups correctly.

The issue arises because the current implementation does not handle mutually exclusive groups correctly when determining required arguments.\n\nHere's a detailed plan to write a test that reveals this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the test environment has a Django management command that includes a mutually exclusive group with required arguments.\n   - Mock or create a simple command (`my_command`) with a mutually exclusive group containing `--shop-id` and `--shop`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use `call_command` with `my_command` and pass `shop_id=1` as a keyword argument.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `call_command` is invoked with a keyword argument that is part of a required mutually exclusive group. The current logic does not correctly handle such groups, leading to a `CommandError`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test by setting up the command with the mutually exclusive group.\n   - Call `call_command` with the keyword argument `shop_id=1`.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors raised during the call.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `CommandError` is raised with the message indicating that one of the mutually exclusive arguments is required.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by confirming the presence of the error message, which indicates the bug is present.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with the other argument in the group (`shop`) to ensure the behavior is consistent.\n   - Test with no arguments to confirm that the error is correctly raised when neither argument is provided.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `CommandError` is raised with the expected message, indicating that the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as the `CommandError` should no longer be raised when `shop_id=1` is passed via `kwargs`.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on reproducing the issue by setting up a scenario where the current logic fails to handle mutually exclusive groups correctly. The test will pass by confirming the presence of the error, thus exposing the bug. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"call_command\", \"path\": \"django/core/management/__init__.py\", \"line\": 76}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_FHZ67LvhJSSkER3vaNVi0bPA", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"create_parser\", \"path\": \"django/core/management/__init__.py\", \"line\": 114}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_E1pnrlHx8l4AAt4FptiAtjoc", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_FHZ67LvhJSSkER3vaNVi0bPA", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom argparse import _SubParsersAction\nfrom django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError\n\ndef call_command(command_name, *args, **options):\n    \"\"\"\n    Call the given command, with the given options and args/kwargs.\n\n    This is the primary API you should use for calling specific commands.\n\n    `command_name` may be a string or a command object.
