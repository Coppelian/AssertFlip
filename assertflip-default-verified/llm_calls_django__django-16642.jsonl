Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `Content-Type` header is not \"text/html\" for both \".Z\" and \".br\" files.\n   - The expected `Content-Type` should be \"application/octet-stream\" or another appropriate type if the MIME type cannot be determined.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with other uncommon file extensions to ensure the MIME type guessing logic is robust.\n   - Test with files that have multiple extensions (e.g., `test.tar.gz.br`) to see how the logic handles such cases.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `Content-Type` is incorrectly set to \"text/html\" for \".Z\" and \".br\" files, thus exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the `Content-Type` is no longer \"text/html\" for these file types.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a test that will pass by exposing the bug (incorrect MIME type) and will fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring that the MIME type is correctly guessed for \".Z\" and \".br\" file extensions. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"FileResponse\", \"path\": \"django/http/response.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_1I1IB7yD6X0f0Hj363CxQTi6", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"mimetypes.guess_type\", \"path\": \"django/http/response.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_w7AfTYgsWjTT57VWjDmT6W92", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_1I1IB7yD6X0f0Hj363CxQTi6", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass FileResponse(StreamingHttpResponse):\n    \"\"\"\n    A streaming HTTP response class optimized for files.\n    \"\"\"\n    block_size = 4096\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, as_attachment=False, filename='', **kwargs):\n        self.as_attachment = as_attachment\n        self.filename = filename\n        self._no_explicit_content_type = 'content_type' not in kwargs or kwargs['content_type'] is None\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n\n    def _set_streaming_content(self, value):\n        ...\n\n    def set_headers(self, filelike):\n        ...\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_w7AfTYgsWjTT57VWjDmT6W92", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\nin mimetypes.py:\n```python\ndef guess_type(url, strict=True):\n    \"\"\"Guess the type of a file based on its URL.\n\n    Return value is a tuple (type, encoding) where type is None if the\n    type can't be guessed (no or unknown suffix) or a string of the\n    form type/subtype, usable for a MIME Content-type header; and\n    encoding is None for no encoding or the name of the program used\n    to encode (e.g. compress or gzip).
