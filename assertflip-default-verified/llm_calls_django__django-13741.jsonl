Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('Set disabled prop on ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\\nDescription\\n\\t\\nCurrently the django.contrib.auth.forms.UserChangeForm defines a clean_password method that returns the initial password value to prevent (accidental) changes to the password value. It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: \\u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example\\nA while ago the forms.Field base class gained the \\u200bdisabled argument to:\\n[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won\u2019t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field\u2019s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form\u2019s initial data.\\nIt seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash. This way the clean_password is no longer necessary and the potential pitfall when using the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField without implementing clean_password is removed.\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable. Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserChangeForm\n\nclass ReadOnlyPasswordHashFieldTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a user instance with a known password hash\n        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', password='testpassword')\n        self.user.set_password('testpassword')\n        self.user.save()\n\n    def test_read_only_password_hash_field_disabled(self):\n        # Initialize the form with the user instance\n        form = UserChangeForm(instance=self.user)\n\n        # Check if the 'disabled' attribute is set on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\n        password_field = form.fields['password']\n        self.assertFalse(password_field.widget.attrs.get('disabled', False))\n        # BUG: The 'disabled' attribute should be True by default to prevent editing\n\n    def test_clean_password_method_necessity(self):\n        # Simulate form data with a tampered password field\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password': 'tamperedpassword',\n        }\n        form = UserChangeForm(data=form_data, instance=self.user)\n\n        # Check if the form's cleaned data returns the initial password hash\n        form.is_valid()  # Ensure form validation is called\n        self.assertEqual(form.cleaned_data.get('password'), self.user.password)\n        # BUG: The form should not accept tampered password data without clean_password method\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brfp0CYJNF7bpQmLhelnYQzqaKVI6", "created": 1752131846, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserChangeForm\n\nclass ReadOnlyPasswordHashFieldTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a user instance with a known password hash\n        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', password='testpassword')\n        self.user.set_password('testpassword')\n        self.user.save()\n\n    def test_read_only_password_hash_field_disabled(self):\n        # Initialize the form with the user instance\n        form = UserChangeForm(instance=self.user)\n\n        # Check if the 'disabled' attribute is set on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\n        password_field = form.fields['password']\n        self.assertTrue(password_field.widget.attrs.get('disabled', False))\n\n    def test_clean_password_method_necessity(self):\n        # Simulate form data with a tampered password field\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password': 'tamperedpassword',\n        }\n        form = UserChangeForm(data=form_data, instance=self.user)\n\n        # Check if the form's cleaned data returns the initial password hash\n        form.is_valid()  # Ensure form validation is called\n        self.assertNotEqual(form.cleaned_data.get('password'), form_data['password'])\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 272, "prompt_tokens": 873, "total_tokens": 1145, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
