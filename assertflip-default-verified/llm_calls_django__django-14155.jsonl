The `ResolverMatch.__repr__()` method currently does not handle `functools.partial` objects in a way that reveals the underlying function and arguments, which is the bug described in the issue ticket.\n\nTo expose this bug, the test will need to:\n1. Create a `functools.partial` object.\n2. Pass this object to the `ResolverMatch` constructor.\n3. Call the `__repr__` method on the `ResolverMatch` instance.\n4. Assert that the `__repr__` output does not include the underlying function and arguments of the `functools.partial`.\n\nThe test will pass because the current implementation does not handle `functools.partial` correctly, thus exposing the bug.\n\nLet's proceed to write the test script.\n", "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 410, "prompt_tokens": 2985, "total_tokens": 3395, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 2304}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
