Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if `strip_accents_unicode` correctly strips accents from both `s1` and `s2`, resulting in `\"n\"`. The test will fail once the bug is fixed if the assertions are not updated to reflect the correct behavior.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by demonstrating that `strip_accents_unicode` does not handle strings in NFKD form correctly. The test will pass under the current buggy implementation but will need to be updated once the bug is fixed to ensure it continues to pass. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"strip_accents_unicode\", \"path\": \"sklearn/feature_extraction/text.py\", \"line\": 114}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_JY4WOdIiAdb3svqBpZq6kRwM", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_JY4WOdIiAdb3svqBpZq6kRwM", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport unicodedata\n\ndef strip_accents_unicode(s):\n    \"\"\"Transform accentuated unicode symbols into their simple counterpart\n\n    Warning: the python-level loop and join operations make this\n    implementation 20 times slower than the strip_accents_ascii basic\n    normalization.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    s : string\n        The string to strip\n\n    See also\n    --------\n    strip_accents_ascii\n        Remove accentuated char for any unicode symbol that has a direct\n        ASCII equivalent.\n    \"\"\"\n    normalized = unicodedata.normalize('NFKD', s)\n    if normalized == s:\n        return s\n    else:\n        return ''.join([c for c in normalized if not unicodedata.combining(c)])\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrkfjdKAzV2QVQ9kKdovRLPrPds4b", "created": 1752150491, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import strip_accents_unicode\n\ndef test_strip_accents_unicode_bug():\n    # Test strings\n    s1 = chr(241)  # \"\u00f1\" as a single code point\n    s2 = chr(110) + chr(771)  # \"n\" followed by a combining tilde\n\n    # Expected behavior: both should be stripped to \"n\"\n    assert strip_accents_unicode(s1) == \"n\"\n    \n    # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n    # s2 should be stripped to \"n\", but it is returned unchanged\n    assert strip_accents_unicode(s2) == s2\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe `strip_accents_unicode` function normalizes the input string using NFKD normalization and checks if the normalized string is the same as the input string.
