The bug occurs when a regular string is concatenated with a lazy string, resulting in a `TypeError` that is caught, leading to the return of an empty string.\n\nThe `SafeString` class is a subclass of `str` and `SafeData`, and it overrides the `__add__` method to handle concatenation with other safe strings. However, the issue arises when a lazy string (which is not a `SafeString`) is involved in the concatenation.\n\nTo expose the bug, the test should attempt to concatenate a regular string with a lazy string using the `add` filter and assert that the result is an empty string, which is incorrect behavior.\n\nThe test will pass if the result is an empty string, indicating the bug is present. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the result will be the correct concatenated string.\n\nI will write a test using Django's `SimpleTestCase` to verify this behavior.\n", "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 395, "prompt_tokens": 2702, "total_tokens": 3097, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 2432}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules and classes, including the `add` filter and any utilities for creating lazy strings.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a regular string and a lazy string (possibly using Django's translation utilities to create a lazy string).\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use the `add` filter to concatenate the regular string with the lazy string.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Attempt to concatenate the strings using the `add` filter.\n   - Capture any exceptions and the output of the filter.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no exception is raised during the concatenation.\n   - Assert that the result is an empty string, which indicates the bug is present.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with empty strings and different combinations of regular and lazy strings to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the result is an empty string when the bug is present, indicating the `TypeError` was caught and handled by returning an empty string.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the result will no longer be an empty string, but the correct concatenated string.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test that will expose the bug by ensuring the test passes when the bug is present and fails once the bug is fixed. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"add\", \"path\": \"django/template/defaultfilters.py\", \"line\": 675}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_Fnj9WnrPX0sMXxWe00CNrHE7", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"SafeString\", \"path\": \"django/utils/safestring.py\", \"line\": 21}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_vJ7swdoqkcFCPHCyE4n9yHxX", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_Fnj9WnrPX0sMXxWe00CNrHE7", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\n@register.filter(is_safe=False)\ndef add(value, arg):\n    \"\"\"Add the arg to the value.\"\"\"\n    try:\n        return int(value) + int(arg)\n    except (ValueError, TypeError):\n        try:\n            return value + arg\n        except Exception:\n            return ''\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_vJ7swdoqkcFCPHCyE4n9yHxX", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass SafeString(str, SafeData):\n    \"\"\"\n    A str subclass that has been specifically marked as \"safe\" for HTML output\n    purposes.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __add__(self, rhs):\n        ...\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        ...\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n\nclass AddFilterLazyStringTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_add_filter_with_lazy_string(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test the add filter with a regular string and a lazy string.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Regular string\n        regular_string = \"Hello, \"\n\n        # Lazy string\n        lazy_string = _(\"world!\")\n\n        # Use the add filter to concatenate the regular string with the lazy string\n        result = add(regular_string, lazy_string)\n\n        # Assert that the result is an empty string, indicating the bug is present\n        self.assertEqual(result, '')  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe `add` filter function attempts to add two values, first by converting them to integers, and if that fails, by concatenating them as strings.
