The error is a `NameError` due to an undefined variable `cotm`. This suggests a logic error in the code where `cotm` is expected to be defined but is not.\n\nLet's analyze the problem and plan a test to expose this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary functions and classes from SymPy, such as `Symbol`, `coth`, `log`, and `tan`.\n   - Define the symbolic variable `x`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create the expression `e = coth(log(tan(x)))`.\n   - Prepare a list of integral values that are known to trigger the bug, such as 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 18, etc.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use the `.subs` method to substitute each of the problematic integral values into the expression `e`.\n   - The bug is triggered when the substitution results in a `NameError` due to `cotm` being undefined.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Iterate over the list of integral values.\n   - For each value, substitute it into the expression using `.subs`.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during substitution.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `NameError` is raised when substituting the problematic values.\n   - Optionally, check that the error message contains the text \"name 'cotm' is not defined\" to confirm the specific issue.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with non-integral values to ensure they do not trigger the bug.\n   - Test with values that are not known to cause the error to verify normal behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if a `NameError` is raised for the specified integral values, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `NameError` will no longer occur, indicating that the substitution works correctly for all values.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a test that will consistently trigger the bug by substituting specific integral values into the expression, capturing the resulting `NameError`, and verifying that the error is due to the undefined `cotm`. The test will pass by confirming the presence of the bug and will fail once the bug is fixed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"coth\", \"path\": \"sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py\", \"line\": 578}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_3xwE8Cg3EaHJqh9Q73eQxsFi", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"cot\", \"path\": \"sympy/functions/elementary/trigonometric.py\", \"line\": 1298}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_9LWIBu886BHBssnZC4ZwGxfl", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_3xwE8Cg3EaHJqh9Q73eQxsFi", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core import cacheit\n\nclass coth(HyperbolicFunction):\n    \"\"\"\n    The hyperbolic cotangent function, `\\\\frac{\\\\cosh(x)}{\\\\sinh(x)}`.\n\n    * coth(x) -> Returns the hyperbolic cotangent of x\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def fdiff(self, argindex=1):\n        ...\n\n    def inverse(self, argindex=1):\n        ...\n\n    @classmethod\n    def eval(cls, arg):\n        ...\n\n    @staticmethod\n    @cacheit\n    def taylor_term(n, x, *previous_terms):\n        ...\n\n    def _eval_conjugate(self):\n        ...\n\n    def as_real_imag(self, deep=True, **hints):\n        ...\n\n    def _eval_rewrite_as_tractable(self, arg):\n        ...\n\n    def _eval_rewrite_as_exp(self, arg):\n        ...\n\n    def _eval_rewrite_as_sinh(self, arg):\n        ...\n\n    def _eval_rewrite_as_cosh(self, arg):\n        ...\n\n    def _eval_rewrite_as_tanh(self, arg):\n        ...\n\n    def _eval_as_leading_term(self, x):\n        ...\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_9LWIBu886BHBssnZC4ZwGxfl", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.basic import cacheit\n\nclass cot(TrigonometricFunction):\n    \"\"\"\n    The cotangent function.\n\n    Returns the cotangent of x (measured in radians).\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    See :func:`sin` for notes about automatic evaluation.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy import cot, pi\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n    >>> cot(x**2).diff(x)\n    2*x*(-cot(x**2)**2 - 1)\n    >>> cot(1).diff(x)\n    0\n    >>> cot(pi/12)\n    sqrt(3) + 2\n\n    See Also\n    ========\n\n    sin, csc, cos, sec, tan\n    asin, acsc, acos, asec, atan, acot, atan2\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..
