Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `id_for_label` method returns an ID that matches the custom `auto_id` format.\n   - This assertion will pass if the bug is present because the current implementation does not use the custom `id`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different `auto_id` formats to ensure the bug is consistently exposed.\n   - Test with a single checkbox and multiple checkboxes to verify behavior across different scenarios.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `id_for_label` method returns the default ID format (`'id_%s_%s'`) instead of the custom `auto_id` format.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the `id_for_label` method now correctly uses the `id` from `self.data['attrs']['id']`.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug in the `BoundWidget.id_for_label` method by checking if it correctly uses the `id` from the widget's attributes. The test will pass with the current buggy implementation and fail once the bug is fixed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BoundField.subwidgets\", \"path\": \"django/forms/boundfield.py\", \"line\": 246}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_Ph3M6LSlLF26iXLiTjWr8v0N", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BoundWidget.id_for_label\", \"path\": \"django/forms/boundfield.py\", \"line\": 246}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_paJaMfzjTbmhPEE68MWIbgAQ", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_Ph3M6LSlLF26iXLiTjWr8v0N", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.functional import cached_property\nfrom django.utils.html import html_safe\n\n@html_safe\nclass BoundField:\n    ...\n\n    @cached_property\n    def subwidgets(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Most widgets yield a single subwidget, but others like RadioSelect and\n        CheckboxSelectMultiple produce one subwidget for each choice.\n\n        This property is cached so that only one database query occurs when\n        rendering ModelChoiceFields.\n        \"\"\"\n        id_ = self.field.widget.attrs.get('id') or self.auto_id\n        attrs = {'id': id_} if id_ else {}\n        attrs = self.build_widget_attrs(attrs)\n        return [BoundWidget(self.field.widget, widget, self.form.renderer) for widget in self.field.widget.subwidgets(self.html_name, self.value(), attrs=attrs)]\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_paJaMfzjTbmhPEE68MWIbgAQ", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.utils.html import html_safe\n\n@html_safe\nclass BoundWidget:\n    ...\n\n    @property\n    def id_for_label(self):\n        return 'id_%s_%s' % (self.data['name'], self.data['index'])\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrgT6tiabb62uR4yGbomDDsOX8FQI", "created": 1752134332, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\n\nclass TestForm(forms.Form):\n    choices = forms.MultipleChoiceField(\n        widget=forms.CheckboxSelectMultiple,\n        choices=[('1', 'Option 1'), ('2', 'Option 2')]\n    )\n\nclass BoundWidgetIdForLabelTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_id_for_label_uses_default_id_format(self):\n        # Create a form with a custom auto_id format\n        form = TestForm(auto_id='custom_id_%s')\n        \n        # Render the form to generate BoundWidget instances\n        rendered_form = form.as_p()\n        \n        # Access the BoundWidget instances for the CheckboxSelectMultiple widget\n        subwidgets = form['choices'].subwidgets\n        \n        # Iterate over the BoundWidget instances and call id_for_label\n        for widget in subwidgets:\n            id_for_label = widget.id_for_label\n            \n            # Assert that the id_for_label method returns the default ID format\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n            self.assertTrue(id_for_label.startswith('id_choices_'))\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe information obtained confirms the behavior described in the issue ticket.

This re-implementation for rendering the \"id\" is confusing and presumably not intended.
