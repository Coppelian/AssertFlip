Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('`pylint` removes first item from `sys.path` when running from `runpy`.\\n### Bug description\\n\\nThis is the line where the first item from sys.path is removed.\\r\\nhttps://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/ce7cccf96454fb6e286e4a8f38919733a0f28f44/pylint/__init__.py#L99\\r\\n\\r\\nI think there should be a check to ensure that the first item is `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing.\\n\\n### Configuration\\n\\n_No response_\\n\\n### Command used\\n\\n```shell\\nRun programmatically to repro this, using this code:\\r\\n\\r\\nimport sys\\r\\nimport runpy\\r\\n\\r\\nsys.path.insert(0, \"something\")\\r\\n\\r\\nrunpy.run_module(\\'pylint\\', run_name=\"__main__\", alter_sys=True)\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Pylint output\\n\\n```shell\\nWhen using pylint extension which bundles the libraries, the extension add them to sys.path depending on user settings. Pylint removes the first entry from sys path causing it to fail to load.\\n```\\n\\n\\n### Expected behavior\\n\\nCheck if  `\"\"`, `\".\"` or `os.getcwd()` before removing the first item from sys.path\\n\\n### Pylint version\\n\\n```shell\\npylint 2.14.5\\n```\\n\\n\\n### OS / Environment\\n\\n_No response_\\n\\n### Additional dependencies\\n\\n_No response_\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable. Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport pytest\nfrom pylint import modify_sys_path\n\ndef test_modify_sys_path_removes_first_entry():\n    # Setup: Add a custom entry to the beginning of sys.path\n    original_sys_path = sys.path[:]\n    custom_entry = \"something\"\n    sys.path.insert(0, custom_entry)\n\n    # Precondition: Ensure the first entry is the custom entry\n    assert sys.path[0] == custom_entry\n\n    # Invoke the function that contains the bug\n    modify_sys_path()\n\n    # Assertion: The first entry should be removed\n    # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n    assert sys.path[0] != custom_entry\n\n    # Cleanup: Restore the original sys.path\n    sys.path = original_sys_path\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrkDooHiSyhmLLxZqlKKCajwGQ9yD", "created": 1752148760, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nimport sys\nimport os\nimport pytest\nfrom pylint import modify_sys_path\n\ndef test_modify_sys_path_removes_first_entry():\n    # Setup: Add a custom entry to the beginning of sys.path\n    original_sys_path = sys.path[:]\n    custom_entry = \"something\"\n    sys.path.insert(0, custom_entry)\n\n    # Precondition: Ensure the first entry is the custom entry\n    assert sys.path[0] == custom_entry\n\n    # Invoke the function that contains the bug\n    modify_sys_path()\n\n    # Assertion: The first entry should not be removed if it's not \"\", \".\", or os.getcwd()\n    assert sys.path[0] == custom_entry\n\n    # Cleanup: Restore the original sys.path\n    sys.path = original_sys_path\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 162, "prompt_tokens": 854, "total_tokens": 1016, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
