ticket. The problem involves a `TypeError` being raised when attempting to sum a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`. Let's break down the problem and plan a test to expose this bug.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - The bug is a `TypeError` that occurs when attempting to add a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The code snippet provided in the issue ticket:\n     ```python\n     from sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame, Vector\n     from sympy import symbols\n     sum([N.x, (0 * N.x)])\n     ```\n   - The error message:\n     ```\n     TypeError: A Vector must be supplied\n     ```\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The `sum` function should be able to handle the addition of a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector` without raising a `TypeError`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the addition of a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n   - Test the addition of multiple `Vectors` with zero-multiplied `Vectors` in different positions in the list.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Adding a `Vector` to a zero scalar.\n   - Adding a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector` where the zero is a result of a more complex expression (e.g., `0 * (N.x + N.y)`).\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize a `ReferenceFrame`.\n   - Create a list of `Vectors` and zero-multiplied `Vectors`.\n   - Use the `sum` function to add them.\n   - Catch and assert the `TypeError` to ensure it is triggered.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond initializing the `ReferenceFrame`.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `TypeError` is raised with the message \"A Vector must be supplied\".\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - The bug is triggered by attempting to add a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector` using the `sum` function.\n\n10. **Assertions that Pass While Exposing the Bug**:\n    - The test should pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules: `ReferenceFrame` and `Vector` from `sympy.physics.vector`.\n   - Initialize a `ReferenceFrame` object.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use the `sum` function to add the list of `Vectors`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the `ReferenceFrame`.\n   - Create the list of `Vectors`.\n   - Attempt to sum the list and catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"A Vector must be supplied\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different zero-multiplied `Vectors` and ensure the error is consistently raised.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by reproducing the conditions under which the error occurs, while ensuring the test passes when the bug is present.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 837, "prompt_tokens": 2858, "total_tokens": 3695, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

The problem involves a `TypeError` being raised when attempting to sum a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`. Let's break down the problem and plan a test to expose this bug.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - The bug is a `TypeError` that occurs when attempting to add a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The code snippet provided in the issue ticket:\n     ```python\n     from sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame, Vector\n     from sympy import symbols\n     sum([N.x, (0 * N.x)])\n     ```\n   - The error message:\n     ```\n     TypeError: A Vector must be supplied\n     ```\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The `sum` function should be able to handle the addition of a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector` without raising a `TypeError`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the addition of a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n   - Test the addition of multiple `Vectors` with zero-multiplied `Vectors` in different positions in the list.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Adding a `Vector` to a zero scalar.\n   - Adding a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector` where the zero is a result of a more complex expression (e.g., `0 * (N.x + N.y)`).\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize a `ReferenceFrame`.\n   - Create a list of `Vectors` and zero-multiplied `Vectors`.\n   - Use the `sum` function to add them.\n   - Catch and assert the `TypeError` to ensure it is triggered.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond initializing the `ReferenceFrame`.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `TypeError` is raised with the message \"A Vector must be supplied\".\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - The bug is triggered by attempting to add a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector` using the `sum` function.\n\n10. **Assertions that Pass While Exposing the Bug**:\n    - The test should pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules: `ReferenceFrame` and `Vector` from `sympy.physics.vector`.\n   - Initialize a `ReferenceFrame` object.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use the `sum` function to add the list of `Vectors`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the `ReferenceFrame`.\n   - Create the list of `Vectors`.\n   - Attempt to sum the list and catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"A Vector must be supplied\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different zero-multiplied `Vectors` and ensure the error is consistently raised.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by reproducing the conditions under which the error occurs, while ensuring the test passes when the bug is present. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Vector.__add__\",\"path\":\"sympy/physics/vector/vector.py\",\"line\":58}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_xUV1m2gj0WJKujnrhrBYOdQ4", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_xUV1m2gj0WJKujnrhrBYOdQ4", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass Vector(object):\n    ...\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"The add operator for Vector. \"\"\"\n        other = _check_vector(other)\n        return Vector(self.args + other.args)\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrlwvtIK57RMuCCmONcoK9Grfsno8", "created": 1752155401, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.pytest import raises\nfrom sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame\n\ndef test_vector_add_zero_multiplication():\n    N = ReferenceFrame('N')\n    with raises(TypeError, match=\"A Vector must be supplied\"):\n        sum([N.x, (0 * N.x)])\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue arises when attempting to sum a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`, which results in a `TypeError`.

The problem involves a `TypeError` being raised when attempting to sum a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`. Let's break down the problem and plan a test to expose this bug.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - The bug is a `TypeError` that occurs when attempting to add a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The code snippet provided in the issue ticket:\n     ```python\n     from sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame, Vector\n     from sympy import symbols\n     sum([N.x, (0 * N.x)])\n     ```\n   - The error message:\n     ```\n     TypeError: A Vector must be supplied\n     ```\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The `sum` function should be able to handle the addition of a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector` without raising a `TypeError`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the addition of a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n   - Test the addition of multiple `Vectors` with zero-multiplied `Vectors` in different positions in the list.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Adding a `Vector` to a zero scalar.\n   - Adding a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector` where the zero is a result of a more complex expression (e.g., `0 * (N.x + N.y)`).\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize a `ReferenceFrame`.\n   - Create a list of `Vectors` and zero-multiplied `Vectors`.\n   - Use the `sum` function to add them.\n   - Catch and assert the `TypeError` to ensure it is triggered.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond initializing the `ReferenceFrame`.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `TypeError` is raised with the message \"A Vector must be supplied\".\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - The bug is triggered by attempting to add a `Vector` to a zero-multiplied `Vector` using the `sum` function.\n\n10. **Assertions that Pass While Exposing the Bug**:\n    - The test should pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules: `ReferenceFrame` and `Vector` from `sympy.physics.vector`.\n   - Initialize a `ReferenceFrame` object.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use the `sum` function to add the list of `Vectors`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the `ReferenceFrame`.\n   - Create the list of `Vectors`.\n   - Attempt to sum the list and catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"A Vector must be supplied\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different zero-multiplied `Vectors` and ensure the error is consistently raised.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by reproducing the conditions under which the error occurs, while ensuring the test passes when the bug is present. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Vector.__add__\",\"path\":\"sympy/physics/vector/vector.py\",\"line\":58}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_xUV1m2gj0WJKujnrhrBYOdQ4", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_xUV1m2gj0WJKujnrhrBYOdQ4", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass Vector(object):\n    ...\n\n    def __add__(self, other):\n        \"\"\"The add operator for Vector. \"\"\"\n        other = _check_vector(other)\n        return Vector(self.args + other.args)\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.pytest import raises\nfrom sympy.physics.vector import ReferenceFrame\n\ndef test_vector_add_zero_multiplication():\n    N = ReferenceFrame('N')\n    with raises(TypeError, match=\"A Vector must be supplied\"):\n        sum([N.x, (0 * N.x)])\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue arises when attempting to sum a list containing a `Vector` and a zero-multiplied `Vector`, which results in a `TypeError`.
