Test Setup:\n   - Import `sympy` and relevant functions.\n   - Define symbolic variables `x1, x2, x3`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use `states = [x1, x2, x3]`.\n   - Set `max_degrees = 3` and `min_degrees = 3`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees)` and sort the result.\n   - The bug is triggered when the function fails to return all monomials of total degree 3.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize variables and degrees.\n   - Call the function with the specified degrees.\n   - Sort and store the result.\n   - Compare the result with the expected set of monomials.\n\n5.

The function does not return all expected monomials that satisfy the condition `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue states: \"The code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have a total degree of 3.\"\n   - The documentation specifies: \"A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function fails to generate all monomials with a total degree equal to `min_degrees` when `min_degrees` is specified.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test with `min_degrees` equal to `max_degrees` and verify that all monomials of that degree are returned.\n   - Test with `min_degrees` less than `max_degrees` to ensure all monomials within the range are returned.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - `min_degrees` equal to `max_degrees`.\n   - `min_degrees` greater than zero.\n   - Empty list of variables.\n   - Single variable with `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.\n\n6. **Outline of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize symbolic variables.\n   - Call `itermonomials` with specific `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.\n   - Sort the result using `monomial_key`.\n   - Compare the result with the expected set of monomials.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Import necessary modules and functions.\n   - Define symbolic variables for testing.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the returned monomials include all combinations that satisfy the degree conditions.\n   - Specifically check for missing monomials like `x1*x2**2` when `min_degrees` is set to 3.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import `sympy` and relevant functions.\n   - Define symbolic variables `x1, x2, x3`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use `states = [x1, x2, x3]`.\n   - Set `max_degrees = 3` and `min_degrees = 3`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees)` and sort the result.\n   - The bug is triggered when the function fails to return all monomials of total degree 3.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize variables and degrees.\n   - Call the function with the specified degrees.\n   - Sort and store the result.\n   - Compare the result with the expected set of monomials.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the result includes monomials like `x1*x2**2`, `x2*x3**2`, etc.\n   - Ensure the result matches the expected set of monomials for the given degrees.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different combinations of `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.\n   - Test with a single variable and multiple variables.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing the missing monomials.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now correctly returns all expected monomials.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"itermonomials\",\"path\":\"sympy/polys/monomials.py\",\"line\":15}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_ZTkTB2Wx6EFLKiCvot83aicY", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_ZTkTB2Wx6EFLKiCvot83aicY", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product\nfrom sympy.core import Mul, S\nfrom sympy.utilities import public\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import is_sequence\n\n@public\ndef itermonomials(variables, max_degrees, min_degrees=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    ``max_degrees`` and ``min_degrees`` are either both integers or both lists.\n    Unless otherwise specified, ``min_degrees`` is either ``0`` or\n    ``[0, ..., 0]``.\n\n    A generator of all monomials ``monom`` is returned, such that\n    either\n    ``min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree``,\n    or\n    ``min_degrees[i] <= degree_list(monom)[i] <= max_degrees[i]``,\n    for all ``i``.\n\n    Case I. ``max_degrees`` and ``min_degrees`` are both integers\n    =============================================================\n\n    Given a set of variables $V$ and a min_degree $N$ and a max_degree $M$\n    generate a set of monomials of degree less than or equal to $N$ and greater\n    than or equal to $M$.

The function does not return all expected monomials that satisfy the condition `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue states: \"The code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have a total degree of 3.\"\n   - The documentation specifies: \"A generator of all monomials `monom` is returned, such that either `min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree`...\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function fails to generate all monomials with a total degree equal to `min_degrees` when `min_degrees` is specified.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test with `min_degrees` equal to `max_degrees` and verify that all monomials of that degree are returned.\n   - Test with `min_degrees` less than `max_degrees` to ensure all monomials within the range are returned.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - `min_degrees` equal to `max_degrees`.\n   - `min_degrees` greater than zero.\n   - Empty list of variables.\n   - Single variable with `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.\n\n6. **Outline of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize symbolic variables.\n   - Call `itermonomials` with specific `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.\n   - Sort the result using `monomial_key`.\n   - Compare the result with the expected set of monomials.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Import necessary modules and functions.\n   - Define symbolic variables for testing.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the returned monomials include all combinations that satisfy the degree conditions.\n   - Specifically check for missing monomials like `x1*x2**2` when `min_degrees` is set to 3.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import `sympy` and relevant functions.\n   - Define symbolic variables `x1, x2, x3`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use `states = [x1, x2, x3]`.\n   - Set `max_degrees = 3` and `min_degrees = 3`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees)` and sort the result.\n   - The bug is triggered when the function fails to return all monomials of total degree 3.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize variables and degrees.\n   - Call the function with the specified degrees.\n   - Sort and store the result.\n   - Compare the result with the expected set of monomials.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the result includes monomials like `x1*x2**2`, `x2*x3**2`, etc.\n   - Ensure the result matches the expected set of monomials for the given degrees.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different combinations of `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.\n   - Test with a single variable and multiple variables.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing the missing monomials.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now correctly returns all expected monomials.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"itermonomials\",\"path\":\"sympy/polys/monomials.py\",\"line\":15}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_ZTkTB2Wx6EFLKiCvot83aicY", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_ZTkTB2Wx6EFLKiCvot83aicY", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import combinations_with_replacement, product\nfrom sympy.core import Mul, S\nfrom sympy.utilities import public\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import is_sequence\n\n@public\ndef itermonomials(variables, max_degrees, min_degrees=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    ``max_degrees`` and ``min_degrees`` are either both integers or both lists.\n    Unless otherwise specified, ``min_degrees`` is either ``0`` or\n    ``[0, ..., 0]``.\n\n    A generator of all monomials ``monom`` is returned, such that\n    either\n    ``min_degree <= total_degree(monom) <= max_degree``,\n    or\n    ``min_degrees[i] <= degree_list(monom)[i] <= max_degrees[i]``,\n    for all ``i``.\n\n    Case I. ``max_degrees`` and ``min_degrees`` are both integers\n    =============================================================\n\n    Given a set of variables $V$ and a min_degree $N$ and a max_degree $M$\n    generate a set of monomials of degree less than or equal to $N$ and greater\n    than or equal to $M$.
