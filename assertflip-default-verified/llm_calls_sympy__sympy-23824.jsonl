Your task is to analyze the described problem in detail and plan your approach to writing the test.\n                       \nFirst, carefully read the ISSUE TICKET and inspect the collected CODE SNIPPETS.\nAnalyze the problem reported critically and plan your approach:\n\n1. Identify the type of bug (exception, logic error, etc.)\n2. Quote relevant parts of the ISSUE TICKET and the CODE SNIPPETS\n3. Determine the expected incorrect behavior\n4. List potential test cases\n5. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n6. Outline the structure of the test function\n7. Consider any necessary setup or cleanup steps\n8. Identify any relevant assertions or checks needed\n\n9. Plan how to trigger the bug while ensuring the test passes.  \n10. Your goal is to plan a test that passes (does not fail during execution), but still triggers and exposes the bug as described in the issue ticket. \n11. Plan assertions that will pass while still exposing the bug.\n\n\nCreate a detailed plan for writing the test. Your plan should focus on the logical structure and approach, without delving into specific implementation details of any testing framework. Ensure your plan is thorough and covers all aspects of triggering and exposing the bug.\n\nPresent your plan in the following format:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - [Describe necessary setup steps]\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - [Detail the input data or mock objects required]\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - [Explain how to consistently trigger the bug]\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - [Outline the logical flow of the test]\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - [List the key assertions needed to expose the bug]\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - [Identify any edge cases or variations to consider]\n\n7.

Here's a detailed plan:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules and classes: `sympy`, `GammaMatrix`, `kahane_simplify`, `LorentzIndex`, and `tensor_indices`.\n   - Define the test function, e.g., `test_kahane_leading_gamma_matrix_bug`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define tensor indices using `tensor_indices` for the Lorentz indices: `mu`, `nu`, `rho`, and `sigma`.\n   - Create two test cases with gamma matrix products:\n     - `t1 = G(mu)*G(-mu)*G(rho)*G(sigma)`\n     - `t = G(rho)*G(sigma)*G(mu)*G(-mu)`\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `kahane_simplify` function is called with an expression where the leading gamma matrices are not contracted, and the contracted matrices are at the end of the product. This causes the leading uncontracted gamma matrices to be reversed in order.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call `kahane_simplify(t1)` and store the result in `r1`.\n   - Call `kahane_simplify(t)` and store the result in `r2`.\n   - Print the results `r1` and `r2` for visual inspection (optional for debugging).\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `r1.equals(4*G(rho)*G(sigma))` to verify the correct behavior for the first test case.\n   - Assert that `r2.equals(4*G(rho)*G(sigma))` to expose the bug in the second test case where the order is reversed.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider additional test cases with different permutations of gamma matrices to ensure the bug is consistently triggered.\n   - Test with no contractions to verify that the expression is returned unchanged.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the assertion for `r2` will fail, indicating the order of gamma matrices is incorrect.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will pass as both assertions will succeed, confirming the correct order of gamma matrices.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines the logical structure and approach to writing a test that reveals the bug in the `kahane_simplify()` function.

In `kahane_simplify()` the leading matrices are removed at the beginning of the function and then inserted at the start of the product at the end of the function, and the insertion loop is just backward.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ll generate a pull request for this shortly.\\r\\n\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nHere are some snippets of possibly relevant code and tests from the project:\n\n<CODE_SNIPPETS>\n('### sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\\n...\\n327|     if n == 4: \\n328|         ind0 = a[0].get_indices()[0] \\n329|         ind1 = a[1].get_indices()[0] \\n330|         ind2 = a[2].get_indices()[0] \\n331|         ind3 = a[3].get_indices()[0] \\n332|  \\n333|         return gctr*(g(ind0, ind1)*g(ind2, ind3) - \\\\ \\n334|            g(ind0, ind2)*g(ind1, ind3) + g(ind0, ind3)*g(ind1, ind2)) \\n335|  \\n336|  \\n337| def kahane_simplify(expression): \\n338|     r\"\"\" \\n339|     This function cancels contracted elements in a product of four \\n340|     dimensional gamma matrices, resulting in an expression equal to the given \\n341|     one, without the contracted gamma matrices. \\n342|  \\n343|     Parameters \\n344|     ========== \\n345|  \\n346|     `expression`    the tensor expression containing the gamma matrices to simplify. \\n347|  \\n348|     Notes \\n349|     ===== \\n350|  \\n351|     If spinor indices are given, the matrices must be given in \\n352|     the order given in the product. \\n353|  \\n354|     Algorithm \\n355|     ========= \\n356|  \\n357|     The idea behind the algorithm is to use some well-known identities, \\n358|     i.e., for contractions enclosing an even number of `\\\\gamma` matrices \\n359|  \\n360|     `\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} \\\\gamma_\\\\mu = 2 (\\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{2N-1}} + \\\\gamma_{a_{2N-1}} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} )` \\n361|  \\n362|     for an odd number of `\\\\gamma` matrices \\n363|  \\n364|     `\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \\\\gamma_\\\\mu = -2 \\\\gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{1}}` \\n365|  \\n366|     Instead of repeatedly applying these identities to cancel out all contracted indices, \\n367|     it is possible to recognize the links that would result from such an operation, \\n368|     the problem is thus reduced to a simple rearrangement of free gamma matrices. \\n369|  \\n370|     Examples \\n371|     ======== \\n372|  \\n373|     When using, always remember that the original expression coefficient \\n374|     has to be handled separately \\n375|  \\n376|     >>> from sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import GammaMatrix as G, LorentzIndex \\n377|     >>> from sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import kahane_simplify \\n378|     >>> from sympy.tensor.tensor import tensor_indices \\n379|     >>> i0, i1, i2 = tensor_indices(\\'i0:3\\', LorentzIndex) \\n380|     >>> ta = G(i0)*G(-i0) \\n381|     >>> kahane_simplify(ta) \\n382|     Matrix([ \\n383|     [4, 0, 0, 0], \\n384|     [0, 4, 0, 0], \\n385|     [0, 0, 4, 0], \\n386|     [0, 0, 0, 4]]) \\n387|     >>> tb = G(i0)*G(i1)*G(-i0) \\n388|     >>> kahane_simplify(tb) \\n389|     -2*GammaMatrix(i1) \\n390|     >>> t = G(i0)*G(-i0) \\n391|     >>> kahane_simplify(t) \\n392|     Matrix([ \\n393|     [4, 0, 0, 0], \\n394|     [0, 4, 0, 0], \\n395|     [0, 0, 4, 0], \\n396|     [0, 0, 0, 4]]) \\n397|     >>> t = G(i0)*G(-i0) \\n398|     >>> kahane_simplify(t) \\n399|     Matrix([ \\n400|     [4, 0, 0, 0], \\n401|     [0, 4, 0, 0], \\n402|     [0, 0, 4, 0], \\n403|     [0, 0, 0, 4]]) \\n404|  \\n405|     If there are no contractions, the same expression is returned \\n406|  \\n407|     >>> tc = G(i0)*G(i1) \\n408|     >>> kahane_simplify(tc) \\n409|     GammaMatrix(i0)*GammaMatrix(i1) \\n410|  \\n411|     References \\n412|     ========== \\n413|  \\n414|     [1] Algorithm for Reducing Contracted Products of gamma Matrices, \\n415|     Joseph Kahane, Journal of Mathematical Physics, Vol. 9, No. 10, October 1968. \\n416|     \"\"\" \\n417|  \\n418|     if isinstance(expression, Mul): \\n419|         return expression \\n420|     if isinstance(expression, TensAdd): \\n421|         return TensAdd(*[kahane_simplify(arg) for arg in expression.args]) \\n422|  \\n423|     if isinstance(expression, Tensor): \\n424|         return expression \\n425|  \\n426|     assert isinstance(expression, TensMul) \\n427|  \\n428|     gammas = expression.args \\n429|  \\n430|     for gamma in gammas: \\n431|         assert gamma.component == GammaMatrix \\n432|  \\n433|     free = expression.free \\n434|     #

Here's a detailed plan:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules and classes: `sympy`, `GammaMatrix`, `kahane_simplify`, `LorentzIndex`, and `tensor_indices`.\n   - Define the test function, e.g., `test_kahane_leading_gamma_matrix_bug`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define tensor indices using `tensor_indices` for the Lorentz indices: `mu`, `nu`, `rho`, and `sigma`.\n   - Create two test cases with gamma matrix products:\n     - `t1 = G(mu)*G(-mu)*G(rho)*G(sigma)`\n     - `t = G(rho)*G(sigma)*G(mu)*G(-mu)`\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when the `kahane_simplify` function is called with an expression where the leading gamma matrices are not contracted, and the contracted matrices are at the end of the product. This causes the leading uncontracted gamma matrices to be reversed in order.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call `kahane_simplify(t1)` and store the result in `r1`.\n   - Call `kahane_simplify(t)` and store the result in `r2`.\n   - Print the results `r1` and `r2` for visual inspection (optional for debugging).\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `r1.equals(4*G(rho)*G(sigma))` to verify the correct behavior for the first test case.\n   - Assert that `r2.equals(4*G(rho)*G(sigma))` to expose the bug in the second test case where the order is reversed.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider additional test cases with different permutations of gamma matrices to ensure the bug is consistently triggered.\n   - Test with no contractions to verify that the expression is returned unchanged.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the assertion for `r2` will fail, indicating the order of gamma matrices is incorrect.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will pass as both assertions will succeed, confirming the correct order of gamma matrices.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines the logical structure and approach to writing a test that reveals the bug in the `kahane_simplify()` function. The test will pass by exposing the bug through a failing assertion, which will succeed once the bug is fixed. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"kahane_simplify\",\"path\":\"sympy/physics/hep/gamma_matrices.py\",\"line\":337}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_VlzKojrZkXFr1zhnzTBhRC8X", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_VlzKojrZkXFr1zhnzTBhRC8X", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.mul import Mul\nfrom sympy.core.singleton import S\nfrom sympy.matrices.dense import eye\nfrom sympy.tensor.tensor import TensMul, TensAdd, Tensor\n\ndef kahane_simplify(expression):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function cancels contracted elements in a product of four\n    dimensional gamma matrices, resulting in an expression equal to the given\n    one, without the contracted gamma matrices.\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    `expression`    the tensor expression containing the gamma matrices to simplify.\n\n    Notes\n    =====\n\n    If spinor indices are given, the matrices must be given in\n    the order given in the product.\n\n    Algorithm\n    =========\n\n    The idea behind the algorithm is to use some well-known identities,\n    i.e., for contractions enclosing an even number of `\\\\gamma` matrices\n\n    `\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} \\\\gamma_\\\\mu = 2 (\\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{2N-1}} + \\\\gamma_{a_{2N-1}} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} )`\n\n    for an odd number of `\\\\gamma` matrices\n\n    `\\\\gamma^\\\\mu \\\\gamma_{a_1} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \\\\gamma_\\\\mu = -2 \\\\gamma_{a_{2N+1}} \\\\gamma_{a_{2N}} \\\\cdots \\\\gamma_{a_{1}}`\n\n    Instead of repeatedly applying these identities to cancel out all contracted indices,\n    it is possible to recognize the links that would result from such an operation,\n    the problem is thus reduced to a simple rearrangement of free gamma matrices.\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    When using, always remember that the original expression coefficient\n    has to be handled separately\n\n    >>> from sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import GammaMatrix as G, LorentzIndex\n    >>> from sympy.physics.hep.gamma_matrices import kahane_simplify\n    >>> from sympy.tensor.tensor import tensor_indices\n    >>> i0, i1, i2 = tensor_indices('i0:3', LorentzIndex)\n    >>> ta = G(i0)*G(-i0)\n    >>> kahane_simplify(ta)\n    Matrix([\n    [4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4]])\n    >>> tb = G(i0)*G(i1)*G(-i0)\n    >>> kahane_simplify(tb)\n    -2*GammaMatrix(i1)\n    >>> t = G(i0)*G(-i0)\n    >>> kahane_simplify(t)\n    Matrix([\n    [4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4]])\n    >>> t = G(i0)*G(-i0)\n    >>> kahane_simplify(t)\n    Matrix([\n    [4, 0, 0, 0],\n    [0, 4, 0, 0],\n    [0, 0, 4, 0],\n    [0, 0, 0, 4]])\n\n    If there are no contractions, the same expression is returned\n\n    >>> tc = G(i0)*G(i1)\n    >>> kahane_simplify(tc)\n    GammaMatrix(i0)*GammaMatrix(i1)\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    [1] Algorithm for Reducing Contracted Products of gamma Matrices,\n    Joseph Kahane, Journal of Mathematical Physics, Vol. 9, No. 10, October 1968.\n    \"\"\"\n    if isinstance(expression, Mul):\n        return expression\n    if isinstance(expression, TensAdd):\n        return TensAdd(*[kahane_simplify(arg) for arg in expression.args])\n    if isinstance(expression, Tensor):\n        return expression\n    assert isinstance(expression, TensMul)\n    gammas = expression.args\n    for gamma in gammas:\n        assert gamma.component == GammaMatrix\n    free = expression.free\n    dum = []\n    for dum_pair in expression.dum:\n        if expression.index_types[dum_pair[0]] == LorentzIndex:\n            dum.append((dum_pair[0], dum_pair[1]))\n    dum = sorted(dum)\n    if len(dum) == 0:\n        return expression\n    first_dum_pos = min(map(min, dum))\n    total_number = len(free) + len(dum) * 2\n    number_of_contractions = len(dum)\n    free_pos = [None] * total_number\n    for i in free:\n        free_pos[i[1]] = i[0]\n    index_is_free = [False] * total_number\n    for i, indx in enumerate(free):\n        index_is_free[indx[1]] = True\n    links = {i: [] for i in range(first_dum_pos, total_number)}\n    cum_sign = -1\n    cum_sign_list = [None] * total_number\n    block_free_count = 0\n    resulting_coeff = S.One\n    resulting_indices = [[]]\n    connected_components = 1\n    for i, is_free in enumerate(index_is_free):\n        if i < first_dum_pos:\n            continue\n        if is_free:\n            block_free_count += 1\n            if block_free_count > 1:\n                links[i -
