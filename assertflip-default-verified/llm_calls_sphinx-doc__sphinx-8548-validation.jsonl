The test sets up a mock documenter for a derived class and uses the `get_class_members` function to retrieve class members. It then asserts that the base class attribute `base_attr` is present and that its docstring is not `None`. The test fails because the docstring for `base_attr` is `None`, which aligns with the reported issue that autodoc does not check for base class namespaces when searching for docstrings. This indicates that the test correctly reproduces the bug described in the issue ticket.", "revealing": true}}
