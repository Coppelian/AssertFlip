Identify the type of bug (exception, logic error, etc.)\n2. Quote relevant parts of the ISSUE TICKET and the CODE SNIPPETS\n3. Determine the expected incorrect behavior\n4. List potential test cases\n5. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n6. Outline the structure of the test function\n7. Consider any necessary setup or cleanup steps\n8.

Test Setup:\n   - Identify the necessary classes and methods involved in the migration optimization process, particularly focusing on `MigrationOptimizer` and its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods.\n   - Ensure that the test environment is set up to simulate a Django project with migrations, including the necessary models and states.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a list of migration operations that includes redundant `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` operations as described in the issue ticket:\n     ```python\n     operations = [\n         migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             unique_together=set(),\n         ),\n         migrations.AlterIndexTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             index_together=set(),\n         ),\n         migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             unique_together={(\"col\",)},\n         ),\n         migrations.AlterIndexTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             index_together={(\"col\",)},\n         ),\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Pass the above list of operations to the `optimize` method of the `MigrationOptimizer` class.\n   - The bug is triggered if the optimizer does not reduce the list to a single `AlterUniqueTogether` and a single `AlterIndexTogether` operation, as described in the issue ticket.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the `MigrationOptimizer` class.\n   - Create a mock app label to pass to the `optimize` method.\n   - Call the `optimize` method with the test input operations and the app label.\n   - Capture the output list of operations.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the length of the output list of operations is 2, indicating that the redundant operations were not optimized away.\n   - Assert that the first operation in the output list is an `AlterUniqueTogether` operation with `unique_together={(\"col\",)}`.\n   - Assert that the second operation is an `AlterIndexTogether` with `index_together={(\"col\",)}`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider cases where there are more than two pairs of redundant operations.\n   - Consider cases where the operations are interspersed with non-optimizable operations (e.g., `RunSQL`).\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `optimize` method does not reduce the list of operations to the optimized form, i.e., it should return a list of length 2 with the specified operations.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `optimize` method will correctly reduce the operations to the optimized form, and the length assertion will fail.\n</plan>", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 556, "prompt_tokens": 20795, "total_tokens": 21351, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

Test Setup:\n   - Identify the necessary classes and methods involved in the migration optimization process, particularly focusing on `MigrationOptimizer` and its `optimize` and `optimize_inner` methods.\n   - Ensure that the test environment is set up to simulate a Django project with migrations, including the necessary models and states.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a list of migration operations that includes redundant `AlterUniqueTogether` and `AlterIndexTogether` operations as described in the issue ticket:\n     ```python\n     operations = [\n         migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             unique_together=set(),\n         ),\n         migrations.AlterIndexTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             index_together=set(),\n         ),\n         migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             unique_together={(\"col\",)},\n         ),\n         migrations.AlterIndexTogether(\n             name='mymodel',\n             index_together={(\"col\",)},\n         ),\n     ]\n     ```\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Pass the above list of operations to the `optimize` method of the `MigrationOptimizer` class.\n   - The bug is triggered if the optimizer does not reduce the list to a single `AlterUniqueTogether` and a single `AlterIndexTogether` operation, as described in the issue ticket.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the `MigrationOptimizer` class.\n   - Create a mock app label to pass to the `optimize` method.\n   - Call the `optimize` method with the test input operations and the app label.\n   - Capture the output list of operations.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the length of the output list of operations is 2, indicating that the redundant operations were not optimized away.\n   - Assert that the first operation in the output list is an `AlterUniqueTogether` operation with `unique_together={(\"col\",)}`.\n   - Assert that the second operation is an `AlterIndexTogether` with `index_together={(\"col\",)}`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider cases where there are more than two pairs of redundant operations.\n   - Consider cases where the operations are interspersed with non-optimizable operations (e.g., `RunSQL`).\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `optimize` method does not reduce the list of operations to the optimized form, i.e., it should return a list of length 2 with the specified operations.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail because the `optimize` method will correctly reduce the operations to the optimized form, and the length assertion will fail.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationOptimizer.optimize\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/optimizer.py\", \"line\": 12}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_wK37199otRpGXXefUdtTJomm", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/optimizer.py\", \"line\": 40}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_MEeaMi6lCpvUQhoVjvopMoL9", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_wK37199otRpGXXefUdtTJomm", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass MigrationOptimizer:\n    ...\n\n    def optimize(self, operations, app_label):\n        \"\"\"\n        Main optimization entry point.
