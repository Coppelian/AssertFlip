Test Setup:\n   - [Describe necessary setup steps]\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - [Detail the input data or mock objects required]\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - [Explain how to consistently trigger the bug]\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - [Outline the logical flow of the test]\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - [List the key assertions needed to expose the bug]\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - [Identify any edge cases or variations to consider]\n\n7.

The mapping is incorrect in the code.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts**:\n   - **ISSUE TICKET**: \n     - \"The current Morse mapping in simpy.crypto.crypto contains an incorrect mapping of `\"----\": \"1\"`.\"\n     - \"The correct mapping is `\".----\": \"1\"`.\"\n   - **CODE SNIPPETS**:\n     - Line 1523: `\"----\": \"1\",` is the incorrect mapping in the Morse code dictionary.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The Morse code for \"1\" is incorrectly mapped, which means any function relying on this mapping will produce incorrect results when encoding or decoding Morse code for \"1\".\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the encoding of the number \"1\" to Morse code.\n   - Test the decoding of Morse code `\".----\"` to the number \"1\".\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider testing other numbers to ensure they are correctly mapped.\n   - Test with a sequence of numbers including \"1\" to see if the error propagates in a larger context.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure access to the Morse code mapping dictionary or the function that utilizes it for encoding/decoding.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the string \"1\" for encoding.\n   - Use the Morse code `\".----\"` for decoding.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to encode \"1\" and check the output.\n   - Attempt to decode `\".----\"` and check the output.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Morse code mapping or access the function that performs encoding/decoding.\n   - Encode the number \"1\" and capture the output.\n   - Decode the Morse code `\".----\"` and capture the output.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that encoding \"1\" results in `\".----\"`.\n   - Assert that decoding `\".----\"` results in \"1\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test encoding and decoding of other numbers to ensure they are not affected by the bug.\n   - Test a sequence like \"0123456789\" to ensure the entire range is correctly handled.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as the current incorrect mapping will not match the expected correct mapping.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the mapping has been corrected.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the incorrect Morse code mapping for \"1\" while ensuring the test passes with the current bug and fails once the bug is fixed.\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom sympy.utilities.pytest import XFAIL\n\n# Assuming the Morse code dictionary is accessible as `morse_code_dict`\nmorse_code_dict = {\n    \"--.\": \"G\", \"....\": \"H\", \n    \"..\": \"I\", \".---\": \"J\", \n    \"-.-\": \"K\", \".-..\": \"L\", \n    \"--\": \"M\", \"-.\": \"N\", \n    \"---\": \"O\", \".--.\": \"P\", \n    \"--.-\": \"Q\", \".-.\": \"R\", \n    \"...\": \"S\", \"-\": \"T\", \n    \"..-\": \"U\", \"...-\": \"V\", \n    \".--\": \"W\", \"-..-\": \"X\", \n    \"-.--\": \"Y\", \"--..\": \"Z\", \n    \"-----\": \"0\", \"----\": \"1\", \n    \"..---\": \"2\", \"...--\": \"3\", \n    \"....-\": \"4\", \".....\": \"5\", \n    \"-....\": \"6\", \"--...\": \"7\", \n    \"---..\": \"8\", \"----.\": \"9\", \n    \".-.-.-\": \".\", \"--..--\": \",\", \n    \"---...\": \":\", \"-.-.-.\": \";\", \n    \"..--..\": \"?\", \"-....-\": \"-\", \n    \"..--.-\": \"_\", \"-.--.\": \"(\", \n    \"-.--.-\": \")\", \".----.\": \"\\'\", \n    \"-...-\": \"=\", \".-.-.\": \"+\"\n}\n\n@XFAIL\ndef test_morse_code_for_1():\n    # Test encoding of \"1\"\n    encoded = [k for k, v in morse_code_dict.items() if v == \"1\"]\n    assert encoded == [\"----\"]  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n    # Test decoding of \".----\"\n    decoded = morse_code_dict.get(\".----\", None)\n    assert decoded is None  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\nInverted test never failed after 3 tries\n</TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\n\nHere is the FEEDBACK given:\n\n<VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\nInversion did not yield a failing test\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brm4eNSKgHzFg6CZZBjmzysA1a4q9", "created": 1752155880, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To address the issue effectively, let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing a test that reveals the bug.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the Issue Ticket:**\n   - **Key Components:** The Morse code mapping for the character \"1\" is incorrect.\n   - **Specific Conditions:** The current mapping is `\"----\": \"1\"`, but it should be `\".----\": \"1\"`.\n   - **Relevant Quote:** \"The current Morse mapping in simpy.crypto.crypto contains an incorrect mapping of `\"----\": \"1\"`.\"\n\n2. **Review the Code Snippets:**\n   - **Relevant Code:** Line 1523 in the code snippet shows the incorrect mapping: `\"----\": \"1\"`.\n   - **Potential Edge Cases:** Ensure that other Morse code mappings are correct and not affected by this bug.\n\n3. **Evaluate the Junior Developer's Previous Attempt:**\n   - **Main Flaws:** The test incorrectly asserts the current incorrect behavior as correct, which is why it doesn't fail when the bug is fixed.\n   - **Correct Insights:** The test correctly identifies the need to check both encoding and decoding.\n\n4. **Analyze the Error Received:**\n   - **Error Analysis:** The test was marked with `XFAIL`, expecting it to fail, but it didn't because the assertions were aligned with the current incorrect behavior.\n\n5. **List Potential Test Cases:**\n   1.

The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5.

Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will fail if the bug is present, as the current incorrect mapping will not match the expected correct mapping.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will pass, indicating that the mapping has been corrected.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan ensures that the test will expose the incorrect Morse code mapping for \"1\" by expecting the correct behavior, which will fail with the current bug and pass once the bug is fixed. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"morse_code_dict\",\"path\":\"sympy/crypto/crypto.py\",\"line\":1513}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_0ZAp8EWbfThOo2VPx0N7Avj7", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_0ZAp8EWbfThOo2VPx0N7Avj7", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on morse_code_dict."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brm4o4s3kzoAuUUton5lAq1xIj534", "created": 1752155890, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.pytest import raises\n\n# Assuming the Morse code dictionary is accessible as `morse_code_dict`\nmorse_code_dict = {\n    \"--.\": \"G\", \"....\": \"H\", \n    \"..\": \"I\", \".---\": \"J\", \n    \"-.-\": \"K\", \".-..\": \"L\", \n    \"--\": \"M\", \"-.\": \"N\", \n    \"---\": \"O\", \".--.\": \"P\", \n    \"--.-\": \"Q\", \".-.\": \"R\", \n    \"...\": \"S\", \"-\": \"T\", \n    \"..-\": \"U\", \"...-\": \"V\", \n    \".--\": \"W\", \"-..-\": \"X\", \n    \"-.--\": \"Y\", \"--..\": \"Z\", \n    \"-----\": \"0\", \"----\": \"1\", \n    \"..---\": \"2\", \"...--\": \"3\", \n    \"....-\": \"4\", \".....\": \"5\", \n    \"-....\": \"6\", \"--...\": \"7\", \n    \"---..\": \"8\", \"----.\": \"9\", \n    \".-.-.-\": \".\", \"--..--\": \",\", \n    \"---...\": \":\", \"-.-.-.\": \";\", \n    \"..--..\": \"?\", \"-....-\": \"-\", \n    \"..--.-\": \"_\", \"-.--.\": \"(\", \n    \"-.--.-\": \")\", \".----.\": \"\\'\", \n    \"-...-\": \"=\", \".-.-.\": \"+\"\n}\n\ndef test_morse_code_bug_exposure():\n    # Test encoding of \"1\"\n    encoded = [k for k, v in morse_code_dict.items() if v == \"1\"]\n    assert encoded == [\"----\"]  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n    # Test decoding of \".----\"\n    decoded = morse_code_dict.get(\".----\", None)\n    assert decoded is None  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is with the Morse code mapping for the character \"1\", which is incorrectly mapped as `\"----\": \"1\"` instead of the correct `\".----\": \"1\"`.
