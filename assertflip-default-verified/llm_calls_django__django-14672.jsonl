Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with models similar to those described in the issue ticket.\n   - Ensure that the Django settings are configured to use a test database.\n   - Define the models `Parent`, `ProxyParent`, `Child`, and `ManyToManyModel` as described in the issue ticket.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6.

been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> Based on the provided ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS, here is a detailed plan to write tests that reveal the bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with models similar to those described in the issue ticket.\n   - Ensure that the Django settings are configured to use a test database.\n   - Define the models `Parent`, `ProxyParent`, `Child`, and `ManyToManyModel` as described in the issue ticket.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `through_fields` is not a list or is `None`.\n   - Test with different configurations of proxy models and normal models to see if the issue is isolated to proxy models.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding the `make_hashable` call), the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions described in the issue ticket to trigger the bug and verify its presence through assertions. The test is designed to pass by confirming the bug's existence, which will help in verifying the fix once implemented. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"ManyToManyRel\", \"path\": \"django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py\", \"line\": 280}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_Xd1CswyjWh8FldsfQE40szcA", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"identity\", \"path\": \"django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py\", \"line\": 309}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_jfEadJWXYYAOZSfsgOdSZs60", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_Xd1CswyjWh8FldsfQE40szcA", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass ManyToManyRel(ForeignObjectRel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Used by ManyToManyField to store information about the relation.\n\n    ``_meta.get_fields()`` returns this class to provide access to the field\n    flags for the reverse relation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, field, to, related_name=None, related_query_name=None, limit_choices_to=None, symmetrical=True, through=None, through_fields=None, db_constraint=True):\n        super().__init__(field, to, related_name=related_name, related_query_name=related_query_name, limit_choices_to=limit_choices_to)\n        if through and (not db_constraint):\n            raise ValueError(\"Can't supply a through model and db_constraint=False\")\n        self.through = through\n        if through_fields and (not through):\n            raise ValueError('Cannot specify through_fields without a through model')\n        self.through_fields = through_fields\n        self.symmetrical = symmetrical\n        self.db_constraint = db_constraint\n\n    @property\n    def identity(self):\n        ...\n\n    def get_related_field(self):\n        ...\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_jfEadJWXYYAOZSfsgOdSZs60", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on identity."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brgb7DE7yzrjLPLJXf40QZgyixsq5", "created": 1752134829, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\nclass ProxyParent(Parent):\n    class Meta:\n        proxy = True\n\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    many_to_many_field = models.ManyToManyField(\n        to=Parent,\n        through=\"ManyToManyModel\",\n        through_fields=['child', 'parent'],\n        related_name=\"something\"\n    )\n\nclass ManyToManyModel(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    second_child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, default=None)\n\nclass ManyToManyRelTest(TestCase):\n    def test_unhashable_through_fields(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that accessing the identity property of ManyToManyRel raises a TypeError\n        due to unhashable 'list' type in through_fields.\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            # Trigger model checks which will access the identity property\n            call_command('check')\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # Assert that the TypeError is raised with the expected message\n            self.assertEqual(str(e), \"unhashable type: 'list'\")\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe information obtained confirms the structure of the `ManyToManyRel` class and its `identity` property.

been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> Based on the provided ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS, here is a detailed plan to write tests that reveal the bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with models similar to those described in the issue ticket.\n   - Ensure that the Django settings are configured to use a test database.\n   - Define the models `Parent`, `ProxyParent`, `Child`, and `ManyToManyModel` as described in the issue ticket.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `through_fields` is not a list or is `None`.\n   - Test with different configurations of proxy models and normal models to see if the issue is isolated to proxy models.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding the `make_hashable` call), the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions described in the issue ticket to trigger the bug and verify its presence through assertions. The test is designed to pass by confirming the bug's existence, which will help in verifying the fix once implemented. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"ManyToManyRel\", \"path\": \"django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py\", \"line\": 280}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_Xd1CswyjWh8FldsfQE40szcA", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"identity\", \"path\": \"django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py\", \"line\": 309}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_jfEadJWXYYAOZSfsgOdSZs60", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_Xd1CswyjWh8FldsfQE40szcA", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass ManyToManyRel(ForeignObjectRel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Used by ManyToManyField to store information about the relation.\n\n    ``_meta.get_fields()`` returns this class to provide access to the field\n    flags for the reverse relation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, field, to, related_name=None, related_query_name=None, limit_choices_to=None, symmetrical=True, through=None, through_fields=None, db_constraint=True):\n        super().__init__(field, to, related_name=related_name, related_query_name=related_query_name, limit_choices_to=limit_choices_to)\n        if through and (not db_constraint):\n            raise ValueError(\"Can't supply a through model and db_constraint=False\")\n        self.through = through\n        if through_fields and (not through):\n            raise ValueError('Cannot specify through_fields without a through model')\n        self.through_fields = through_fields\n        self.symmetrical = symmetrical\n        self.db_constraint = db_constraint\n\n    @property\n    def identity(self):\n        ...\n\n    def get_related_field(self):\n        ...\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_jfEadJWXYYAOZSfsgOdSZs60", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on identity."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\nclass ProxyParent(Parent):\n    class Meta:\n        proxy = True\n\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    many_to_many_field = models.ManyToManyField(\n        to=Parent,\n        through=\"ManyToManyModel\",\n        through_fields=['child', 'parent'],\n        related_name=\"something\"\n    )\n\nclass ManyToManyModel(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    second_child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, default=None)\n\nclass ManyToManyRelTest(TestCase):\n    def test_unhashable_through_fields(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that accessing the identity property of ManyToManyRel raises a TypeError\n        due to unhashable 'list' type in through_fields.\n        \"\"\"\n        try:\n            # Trigger model checks which will access the identity property\n            call_command('check')\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # Assert that the TypeError is raised with the expected message\n            self.assertEqual(str(e), \"unhashable type: 'list'\")\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe information obtained confirms the structure of the `ManyToManyRel` class and its `identity` property.

been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> Based on the provided ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS, here is a detailed plan to write tests that reveal the bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with models similar to those described in the issue ticket.\n   - Ensure that the Django settings are configured to use a test database.\n   - Define the models `Parent`, `ProxyParent`, `Child`, and `ManyToManyModel` as described in the issue ticket.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `through_fields` is not a list or is `None`.\n   - Test with different configurations of proxy models and normal models to see if the issue is isolated to proxy models.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding the `make_hashable` call), the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions described in the issue ticket to trigger the bug and verify its presence through assertions. The test is designed to pass by confirming the bug's existence, which will help in verifying the fix once implemented. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Ensure the test models are part of a test app\nsettings.configure(INSTALLED_APPS=['test_app'])\n\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ProxyParent(Parent):\n    class Meta:\n        proxy = True\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    many_to_many_field = models.ManyToManyField(\n        to=Parent,\n        through=\"ManyToManyModel\",\n        through_fields=['child', 'parent'],\n        related_name=\"something\"\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyModel(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    second_child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, default=None)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyRelTest(TestCase):\n    def test_unhashable_through_fields(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that accessing the identity property of ManyToManyRel raises a TypeError\n        due to unhashable 'list' type in through_fields.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Register the models with the app registry\n        apps.register_model('test_app', Parent)\n        apps.register_model('test_app', ProxyParent)\n        apps.register_model('test_app', Child)\n        apps.register_model('test_app', ManyToManyModel)\n\n        try:\n            # Trigger model checks which will access the identity property\n            call_command('check')\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # Assert that the TypeError is raised with the expected message\n            self.assertEqual(str(e), \"unhashable type: 'list'\")\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> Based on the provided ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS, here is a detailed plan to write tests that reveal the bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with models similar to those described in the issue ticket.\n   - Ensure that the Django settings are configured to use a test database.\n   - Define the models `Parent`, `ProxyParent`, `Child`, and `ManyToManyModel` as described in the issue ticket.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `through_fields` is not a list or is `None`.\n   - Test with different configurations of proxy models and normal models to see if the issue is isolated to proxy models.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding the `make_hashable` call), the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions described in the issue ticket to trigger the bug and verify its presence through assertions. The test is designed to pass by confirming the bug's existence, which will help in verifying the fix once implemented. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.apps import apps\n\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ProxyParent(Parent):\n    class Meta:\n        proxy = True\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    many_to_many_field = models.ManyToManyField(\n        to=Parent,\n        through=\"ManyToManyModel\",\n        through_fields=['child', 'parent'],\n        related_name=\"something\"\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyModel(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    second_child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, default=None)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyRelTest(TestCase):\n    def test_unhashable_through_fields(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that accessing the identity property of ManyToManyRel raises a TypeError\n        due to unhashable 'list' type in through_fields.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Register the models with the app registry\n        apps.register_model('test_app', Parent)\n        apps.register_model('test_app', ProxyParent)\n        apps.register_model('test_app', Child)\n        apps.register_model('test_app', ManyToManyModel)\n\n        try:\n            # Trigger model checks which will access the identity property\n            call_command('check')\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # Assert that the TypeError is raised with the expected message\n            self.assertEqual(str(e), \"unhashable type: 'list'\")\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        else:\n            # If no exception is raised, the test should fail\n            self.fail(\"TypeError not raised\")\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The test should expect a `TypeError` to be raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\". This will confirm the presence of the bug, as the test will pass if the error is raised.\n\nI will use the `get_info` tool to obtain more information about the `ManyToManyRel` class and its `identity` property to ensure that the test is correctly targeting the buggy code.\n\nLet's proceed with the test script.\n\n", "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_mnwtWXFGJI61akHtZjuFGJFR", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass ManyToManyRel(ForeignObjectRel):\n    \"\"\"\n    Used by ManyToManyField to store information about the relation.\n\n    ``_meta.get_fields()`` returns this class to provide access to the field\n    flags for the reverse relation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, field, to, related_name=None, related_query_name=None, limit_choices_to=None, symmetrical=True, through=None, through_fields=None, db_constraint=True):\n        super().__init__(field, to, related_name=related_name, related_query_name=related_query_name, limit_choices_to=limit_choices_to)\n        if through and (not db_constraint):\n            raise ValueError(\"Can't supply a through model and db_constraint=False\")\n        self.through = through\n        if through_fields and (not through):\n            raise ValueError('Cannot specify through_fields without a through model')\n        self.through_fields = through_fields\n        self.symmetrical = symmetrical\n        self.db_constraint = db_constraint\n\n    @property\n    def identity(self):\n        ...\n\n    def get_related_field(self):\n        ...\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrgblxMHfaT7qcgQ7tF3yjD0KqgOC", "created": 1752134869, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\n\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ProxyParent(Parent):\n    class Meta:\n        proxy = True\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    many_to_many_field = models.ManyToManyField(\n        to=Parent,\n        through=\"ManyToManyModel\",\n        through_fields=['child', 'parent'],\n        related_name=\"something\"\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyModel(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    second_child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, default=None)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyRelTest(TestCase):\n    def test_unhashable_through_fields(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that accessing the identity property of ManyToManyRel raises a TypeError\n        due to unhashable 'list' type in through_fields.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Trigger model checks which will access the identity property\n        try:\n            call_command('check')\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # Assert that the TypeError is raised with the expected message\n            self.assertEqual(str(e), \"unhashable type: 'list'\")\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        else:\n            # If no exception is raised, the test should fail\n            self.fail(\"TypeError not raised\")\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 382, "prompt_tokens": 5631, "total_tokens": 6013, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> Based on the provided ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS, here is a detailed plan to write tests that reveal the bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with models similar to those described in the issue ticket.\n   - Ensure that the Django settings are configured to use a test database.\n   - Define the models `Parent`, `ProxyParent`, `Child`, and `ManyToManyModel` as described in the issue ticket.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `through_fields` is not a list or is `None`.\n   - Test with different configurations of proxy models and normal models to see if the issue is isolated to proxy models.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding the `make_hashable` call), the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions described in the issue ticket to trigger the bug and verify its presence through assertions.

Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `through_fields` is not a list or is `None`.\n   - Test with different configurations of proxy models and normal models to see if the issue is isolated to proxy models.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding the `make_hashable` call), the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions described in the issue ticket to trigger the bug and verify its presence through assertions. The test is designed to pass by confirming the bug's existence, which will help in verifying the fix once implemented. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.core.management import call_command\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ProxyParent(Parent):\n    class Meta:\n        proxy = True\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    many_to_many_field = models.ManyToManyField(\n        to=Parent,\n        through=\"ManyToManyModel\",\n        through_fields=['child', 'parent'],\n        related_name=\"something\"\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyModel(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    second_child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, default=None)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyRelTest(TestCase):\n    def test_unhashable_through_fields(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that a TypeError is raised when accessing the identity property\n        of ManyToManyRel with unhashable 'through_fields'.\n        \"\"\"\n        with self.assertRaises(TypeError) as cm:\n            call_command('check')\n        \n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"unhashable type: 'list'\", str(cm.exception))\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7.

Test Input:\n   - Create instances of the `Parent` and `Child` models.\n   - Define a `ManyToManyField` in the `Child` model with `through` set to `ManyToManyModel` and `through_fields` as a list `['child', 'parent']`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to perform a Django management command or operation that triggers model checks, such as `makemigrations` or `check`.\n   - This should invoke the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`, which includes `through_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test case.\n   - Set up the models and relationships as described.\n   - Execute a management command that triggers the model checks.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors that occur during this process.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message \"unhashable type: 'list'\" when the `identity` property is accessed.\n   - Ensure that the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its presence.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `through_fields` is not a list or is `None`.\n   - Test with different configurations of proxy models and normal models to see if the issue is isolated to proxy models.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed (by adding the `make_hashable` call), the test should fail because the `TypeError` will no longer be raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions described in the issue ticket to trigger the bug and verify its presence through assertions. The test is designed to pass by confirming the bug's existence, which will help in verifying the fix once implemented. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass Parent(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ProxyParent(Parent):\n    class Meta:\n        proxy = True\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass Child(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n    many_to_many_field = models.ManyToManyField(\n        to=Parent,\n        through=\"ManyToManyModel\",\n        through_fields=['child', 'parent'],\n        related_name=\"something\"\n    )\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyModel(models.Model):\n    parent = models.ForeignKey(Parent, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='+')\n    second_child = models.ForeignKey(Child, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True, default=None)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ManyToManyRelTest(TestCase):\n    def test_unhashable_through_fields(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that the identity property of ManyToManyRel includes unhashable 'through_fields'.\n        \"\"\"\n        rel = Child._meta.get_field('many_to_many_field').remote_field\n        identity = rel.identity\n\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIsInstance(identity[1], list)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
