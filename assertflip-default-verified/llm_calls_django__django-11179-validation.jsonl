According to the issue ticket, the primary key (PK) of a model instance should be set to None after the instance is deleted. The test creates an instance of a simple model, deletes it, and then checks if the PK is None. However, the test fails because the PK is not None after deletion, which aligns with the reported issue. The test correctly reproduces the bug described in the issue ticket, as it demonstrates that the PK remains set after deletion, contrary to the expected behavior described in the issue.", "revealing": true}}
