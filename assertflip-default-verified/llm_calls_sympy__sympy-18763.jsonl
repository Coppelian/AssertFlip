Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n(\"Incorrect parenthesizing of Subs\\nHere is an example.\\r\\n```python\\r\\n>>> from sympy import Subs\\r\\n>>> from sympy.abc import x,y\\r\\n>>> 3*Subs(-x+y, (x,),(1,))\\r\\n```\\r\\nLaTeX printing of this gives:  \\r\\n```python\\r\\n'3 \\\\\\\\left. - x + y \\\\\\\\right|_{\\\\\\\\substack{ x=1 }}'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/76/ql_9672fd7e62c909ff3d9ac8543c2e2576_l3.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nIt would be better to be parenthesized to:  \\r\\n```python\\r\\n'3 \\\\\\\\left. \\\\\\\\left(- x + y\\\\\\\\right) \\\\\\\\right|_{\\\\\\\\substack{ x=1 }}'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\n![image](https://quicklatex.com/cache3/bf/ql_936ffdb876e784206d4c54bb93d28dbf_l3.png)\\r\\n\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable.
