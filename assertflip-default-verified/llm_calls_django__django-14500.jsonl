Let's break down the problem and plan a test accordingly.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - This is a logic error in the migration system where the squashed migration is not correctly marked as unapplied.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - **Issue Ticket**: \"When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.\"\n   - **Code Snippets**:\n     - `unapply_migration` method in `executor.py` (lines 246-262) handles the unapplication of migrations.\n     - `record_unapplied` method in `recorder.py` (lines 89-92) is responsible for marking migrations as unapplied.\n     - `check_replacements` method in `loader.py` (lines 264-272) deals with marking replacement migrations.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When a squashed migration is unapplied, it should be marked as unapplied only if all its replaced migrations are unapplied. The bug causes the squashed migration to be marked as unapplied even if the replaced migrations are still present.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations still present.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with some replaced migrations unapplied.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations unapplied.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider scenarios where the squashed migration is partially unapplied.\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a mock database with a squashed migration and its replaced migrations.\n   - Ensure the `MigrationRecorder` is initialized to track applied and unapplied migrations.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a squashed migration that replaces multiple individual migrations.\n   - Ensure all replaced migrations are marked as applied initially.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to unapply the squashed migration while the replaced migrations are still marked as applied.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the migration environment with the squashed and replaced migrations.\n   - Mark all replaced migrations as applied.\n   - Call the `unapply_migration` method on the squashed migration.\n   - Check the state of the squashed migration and replaced migrations in the `MigrationRecorder`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied if any replaced migrations are still applied.\n   - Assert that replaced migrations remain marked as applied.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present to ensure the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied.\n   - Test with some replaced migrations unapplied to verify partial unapplication behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied when replaced migrations are still applied, exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied only when all replaced migrations are unapplied.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the reported issue, ensuring that the bug is exposed while the test itself passes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 721, "prompt_tokens": 2469, "total_tokens": 3190, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

Let's break down the problem and plan a test accordingly.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - This is a logic error in the migration system where the squashed migration is not correctly marked as unapplied.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - **Issue Ticket**: \"When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.\"\n   - **Code Snippets**:\n     - `unapply_migration` method in `executor.py` (lines 246-262) handles the unapplication of migrations.\n     - `record_unapplied` method in `recorder.py` (lines 89-92) is responsible for marking migrations as unapplied.\n     - `check_replacements` method in `loader.py` (lines 264-272) deals with marking replacement migrations.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When a squashed migration is unapplied, it should be marked as unapplied only if all its replaced migrations are unapplied. The bug causes the squashed migration to be marked as unapplied even if the replaced migrations are still present.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations still present.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with some replaced migrations unapplied.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations unapplied.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider scenarios where the squashed migration is partially unapplied.\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a mock database with a squashed migration and its replaced migrations.\n   - Ensure the `MigrationRecorder` is initialized to track applied and unapplied migrations.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a squashed migration that replaces multiple individual migrations.\n   - Ensure all replaced migrations are marked as applied initially.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to unapply the squashed migration while the replaced migrations are still marked as applied.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the migration environment with the squashed and replaced migrations.\n   - Mark all replaced migrations as applied.\n   - Call the `unapply_migration` method on the squashed migration.\n   - Check the state of the squashed migration and replaced migrations in the `MigrationRecorder`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied if any replaced migrations are still applied.\n   - Assert that replaced migrations remain marked as applied.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present to ensure the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied.\n   - Test with some replaced migrations unapplied to verify partial unapplication behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied when replaced migrations are still applied, exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied only when all replaced migrations are unapplied.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the reported issue, ensuring that the bug is exposed while the test itself passes. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"line\": 246}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_8T9lfBl1q63roirVpCWkMP83", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"line\": 89}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_OXBzutFqNMdgRjgxlXRXBXox", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationLoader.check_replacements\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\", \"line\": 264}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_6L64Feg8Z73WV8V76LEN3H4k", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_8T9lfBl1q63roirVpCWkMP83", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass MigrationExecutor:\n    ...\n\n    def unapply_migration(self, state, migration, fake=False):\n        \"\"\"Run a migration backwards.\"\"\"\n        if self.progress_callback:\n            self.progress_callback('unapply_start', migration, fake)\n        if not fake:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor(atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:\n                state = migration.unapply(state, schema_editor)\n        if migration.replaces:\n            for app_label, name in migration.replaces:\n                self.recorder.record_unapplied(app_label, name)\n        else:\n            self.recorder.record_unapplied(migration.app_label, migration.name)\n        if self.progress_callback:\n            self.progress_callback('unapply_success', migration, fake)\n        return state\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_OXBzutFqNMdgRjgxlXRXBXox", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass MigrationRecorder:\n    ...\n\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_6L64Feg8Z73WV8V76LEN3H4k", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on MigrationLoader.check_replacements."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrgT6LtSwXy1MT7C4RlwwFodrO8el", "created": 1752134332, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor\nfrom django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder\nfrom unittest.mock import MagicMock\n\nclass SquashedMigrationUnapplyTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        #

Let's break down the problem and plan a test accordingly.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - This is a logic error in the migration system where the squashed migration is not correctly marked as unapplied.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - **Issue Ticket**: \"When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.\"\n   - **Code Snippets**:\n     - `unapply_migration` method in `executor.py` (lines 246-262) handles the unapplication of migrations.\n     - `record_unapplied` method in `recorder.py` (lines 89-92) is responsible for marking migrations as unapplied.\n     - `check_replacements` method in `loader.py` (lines 264-272) deals with marking replacement migrations.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When a squashed migration is unapplied, it should be marked as unapplied only if all its replaced migrations are unapplied. The bug causes the squashed migration to be marked as unapplied even if the replaced migrations are still present.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations still present.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with some replaced migrations unapplied.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations unapplied.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider scenarios where the squashed migration is partially unapplied.\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a mock database with a squashed migration and its replaced migrations.\n   - Ensure the `MigrationRecorder` is initialized to track applied and unapplied migrations.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a squashed migration that replaces multiple individual migrations.\n   - Ensure all replaced migrations are marked as applied initially.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to unapply the squashed migration while the replaced migrations are still marked as applied.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the migration environment with the squashed and replaced migrations.\n   - Mark all replaced migrations as applied.\n   - Call the `unapply_migration` method on the squashed migration.\n   - Check the state of the squashed migration and replaced migrations in the `MigrationRecorder`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied if any replaced migrations are still applied.\n   - Assert that replaced migrations remain marked as applied.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present to ensure the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied.\n   - Test with some replaced migrations unapplied to verify partial unapplication behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied when replaced migrations are still applied, exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied only when all replaced migrations are unapplied.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the reported issue, ensuring that the bug is exposed while the test itself passes. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationExecutor.unapply_migration\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/executor.py\", \"line\": 246}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_8T9lfBl1q63roirVpCWkMP83", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationRecorder.record_unapplied\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/recorder.py\", \"line\": 89}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_OXBzutFqNMdgRjgxlXRXBXox", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"MigrationLoader.check_replacements\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/loader.py\", \"line\": 264}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_6L64Feg8Z73WV8V76LEN3H4k", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_8T9lfBl1q63roirVpCWkMP83", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass MigrationExecutor:\n    ...\n\n    def unapply_migration(self, state, migration, fake=False):\n        \"\"\"Run a migration backwards.\"\"\"\n        if self.progress_callback:\n            self.progress_callback('unapply_start', migration, fake)\n        if not fake:\n            with self.connection.schema_editor(atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:\n                state = migration.unapply(state, schema_editor)\n        if migration.replaces:\n            for app_label, name in migration.replaces:\n                self.recorder.record_unapplied(app_label, name)\n        else:\n            self.recorder.record_unapplied(migration.app_label, migration.name)\n        if self.progress_callback:\n            self.progress_callback('unapply_success', migration, fake)\n        return state\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_OXBzutFqNMdgRjgxlXRXBXox", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass MigrationRecorder:\n    ...\n\n    def record_unapplied(self, app, name):\n        \"\"\"Record that a migration was unapplied.\"\"\"\n        self.ensure_schema()\n        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_6L64Feg8Z73WV8V76LEN3H4k", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on MigrationLoader.check_replacements."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor\nfrom django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder\nfrom unittest.mock import MagicMock\n\nclass SquashedMigrationUnapplyTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Set up the mock migration environment\n        self.executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)\n        self.recorder = MigrationRecorder(connection)\n        \n        # Mock squashed migration and its replaced migrations\n        self.squashed_migration = MagicMock()\n        self.squashed_migration.app_label = 'app'\n        self.squashed_migration.name = '0002_squashed'\n        self.squashed_migration.replaces = [('app', '0001_initial'), ('app', '0002_auto')]\n        \n        # Mark replaced migrations as applied\n        for app_label, name in self.squashed_migration.replaces:\n            self.recorder.record_applied(app_label, name)\n        \n        # Ensure squashed migration is initially marked as applied\n        self.recorder.record_applied(self.squashed_migration.app_label, self.squashed_migration.name)\n\n    def test_unapply_squashed_migration_with_replaced_present(self):\n        # Unapply the squashed migration\n        self.executor.unapply_migration(None, self.squashed_migration)\n        \n        # Check if the squashed migration is marked as unapplied\n        unapplied_migrations = self.recorder.applied_migrations()\n        \n        # Assert that the squashed migration is incorrectly marked as unapplied\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn((self.squashed_migration.app_label, self.squashed_migration.name), unapplied_migrations)\n        \n        # Cleanup: Ensure no state pollution\n        self.recorder.flush()\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe information obtained confirms the logic in the `unapply_migration` and `record_unapplied` methods.

Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's break down the problem and plan a test accordingly.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - This is a logic error in the migration system where the squashed migration is not correctly marked as unapplied.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - **Issue Ticket**: \"When unapplying a squashed migration and the replaced migration files are still around, the MigrationExecutor mark the squash migration as unapplied, too, not only the replaced migrations.\"\n   - **Code Snippets**:\n     - `unapply_migration` method in `executor.py` (lines 246-262) handles the unapplication of migrations.\n     - `record_unapplied` method in `recorder.py` (lines 89-92) is responsible for marking migrations as unapplied.\n     - `check_replacements` method in `loader.py` (lines 264-272) deals with marking replacement migrations.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When a squashed migration is unapplied, it should be marked as unapplied only if all its replaced migrations are unapplied. The bug causes the squashed migration to be marked as unapplied even if the replaced migrations are still present.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations still present.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with some replaced migrations unapplied.\n   - Unapply a squashed migration with all replaced migrations unapplied.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider scenarios where the squashed migration is partially unapplied.\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a mock database with a squashed migration and its replaced migrations.\n   - Ensure the `MigrationRecorder` is initialized to track applied and unapplied migrations.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a squashed migration that replaces multiple individual migrations.\n   - Ensure all replaced migrations are marked as applied initially.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Attempt to unapply the squashed migration while the replaced migrations are still marked as applied.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the migration environment with the squashed and replaced migrations.\n   - Mark all replaced migrations as applied.\n   - Call the `unapply_migration` method on the squashed migration.\n   - Check the state of the squashed migration and replaced migrations in the `MigrationRecorder`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied if any replaced migrations are still applied.\n   - Assert that replaced migrations remain marked as applied.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with no replaced migrations present to ensure the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied.\n   - Test with some replaced migrations unapplied to verify partial unapplication behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the squashed migration is not marked as unapplied when replaced migrations are still applied, exposing the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the squashed migration is correctly marked as unapplied only when all replaced migrations are unapplied.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the reported issue, ensuring that the bug is exposed while the test itself passes. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom django.db.migrations.executor import MigrationExecutor\nfrom django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder\nfrom unittest.mock import MagicMock\n\nclass SquashedMigrationUnapplyTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Set up the mock migration environment\n        self.executor = MigrationExecutor(connection)\n        self.recorder = MigrationRecorder(connection)\n        \n        # Mock squashed migration and its replaced migrations\n        self.squashed_migration = MagicMock()\n        self.squashed_migration.app_label = 'app'\n        self.squashed_migration.name = '0002_squashed'\n        self.squashed_migration.replaces = [('app', '0001_initial'), ('app', '0002_auto')]\n        \n        # Mark replaced migrations as applied\n        for app_label, name in self.squashed_migration.replaces:\n            self.recorder.record_applied(app_label, name)\n        \n        # Ensure squashed migration is initially marked as applied\n        self.recorder.record_applied(self.squashed_migration.app_label, self.squashed_migration.name)\n\n    def test_unapply_squashed_migration_with_replaced_present(self):\n        # Unapply the squashed migration with fake=True to avoid schema editor issues\n        self.executor.unapply_migration(None, self.squashed_migration, fake=True)\n        \n        # Check if the squashed migration is marked as unapplied\n        unapplied_migrations = self.recorder.applied_migrations()\n        \n        # Assert that the squashed migration is incorrectly marked as unapplied\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn((self.squashed_migration.app_label, self.squashed_migration.name), unapplied_migrations)\n        \n        # Cleanup: Ensure no state pollution\n        self.recorder.flush()\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
