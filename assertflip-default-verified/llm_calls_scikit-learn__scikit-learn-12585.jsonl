Specifically, the line `new_object_params = estimator.get_params(deep=False)` assumes `estimator` is an instance, not a class.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When `clone` is called with a class as a parameter, it should not raise an error, but it currently does due to the incorrect assumption that `estimator` is always an instance.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test `clone` with a parameter that is a class type (e.g., `StandardScaler`).\n   - Test `clone` with a parameter that is an instance to ensure normal behavior is unaffected.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider cases where the parameter is a class but not an estimator.\n   - Consider cases where the parameter is a subclass of an estimator.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. **Test Setup**:\n   - Import necessary modules and functions, such as `clone` from `sklearn.base` and `StandardScaler` from `sklearn.preprocessing`.\n\n2. **Test Input**:\n   - Use `StandardScaler` as a class type parameter in the `clone` function.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering**:\n   - Call `clone` with an estimator that has a parameter set to a class type (e.g., `StandardScaler(with_mean=StandardScaler)`).\n\n4. **Test Structure**:\n   - Define a test function.\n   - Within the function, call `clone` with the specified input.\n   - Ensure the function does not raise an error.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Assert that no exception is raised during the execution of `clone`.\n   - Optionally, check that the returned object is of the expected type.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Test with a non-estimator class to ensure the function handles it gracefully.\n   - Test with a subclass of an estimator to verify behavior consistency.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the `clone` function does not raise an error when a class type is used as a parameter. The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the current behavior is to raise an error.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by using a class type as a parameter in the `clone` function, ensuring the test passes by not raising an error, which is the current incorrect behavior. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"clone\",\"path\":\"sklearn/base.py\",\"line\":30}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_YvYKEMBTWx05RGhYB4XPj9Vy", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_YvYKEMBTWx05RGhYB4XPj9Vy", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport copy\nfrom sklearn.externals import six\n\ndef clone(estimator, safe=True):\n    \"\"\"Constructs a new estimator with the same parameters.\n\n    Clone does a deep copy of the model in an estimator\n    without actually copying attached data.
