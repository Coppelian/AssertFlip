According to the issue ticket, the expected behavior is that after calling `cla()`, the `.axes` attribute of the artist should be `None`. However, the test error shows that the `.axes` attribute is not `None` after calling `cla()`, which aligns with the reported bug. The test correctly reproduces the issue described in the ticket, as it demonstrates that the `.axes` attribute remains set to an Axes object instead of being unset. Therefore, the test is valid and correctly reveals the bug.", "revealing": true}}
