The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5.

The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models import F\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\n\n# Define a test model within a test app\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-28')  # Last week of 2020\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-04')  # First week of 2021\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup_uses_between(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year lookup\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020)\n        query_str = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN 2020-01-01 AND 2020-12-31', query_str)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        # The correct behavior should include EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...) in the query\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        # Cleanup test data\n        DTModel.objects.all().delete()\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models import F\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\nfrom django.apps import apps, AppConfig\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Define a test app configuration\nclass TestAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'test_app'\n    verbose_name = \"Test App\"\n\n# Register the test app\nif not apps.is_installed('test_app'):\n    apps.app_configs['test_app'] = TestAppConfig('test_app', 'test_app')\n    apps.app_configs['test_app'].models = {}\n    apps.set_installed_apps(settings.INSTALLED_APPS + ['test_app'])\n\n# Define a test model within the test app\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year lookup\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query_str = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN 2020-01-01 AND 2020-12-31', query_str)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Check if the results of the query are incorrect due to the bug\n        results = list(qs)\n        self.assertNotEqual(len(results), 1)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        # The query should return only the object with start_date in the ISO year 2020\n        # However, due to the bug, it returns incorrect results\n        self.assertNotEqual(len(qs), 1)\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\n\n# Define a test model\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year lookup\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query_str = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN', query_str)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Check if the results of the query are incorrect due to the bug\n        results = list(qs)\n        self.assertEqual(len(results), 2)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        # The query should return only the object with start_date in the ISO year 2020\n        # However, due to the bug, it returns incorrect results\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\nfrom django.db import connection\n\n# Define a test model\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create the table for the test model\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            schema_editor.create_model(DTModel)\n\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        # Clean up the test database\n        with self.connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            schema_editor.delete_model(DTModel)\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup_uses_between(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN', query)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\nfrom django.db import connection\n\n# Define a test model\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpTestData(cls):\n        # Create the table for the test model\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            schema_editor.create_model(DTModel)\n\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup_uses_between(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN', query)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\n\n# Define a test model\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpTestData(cls):\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup_uses_between(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN', query)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\nfrom django.db import connection\n\n# Define a test model\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpTestData(cls):\n        # Create the table manually since migrations are not applied\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            schema_editor.create_model(DTModel)\n\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup_uses_between(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN', query)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem arises when the optimization to use `BETWEEN` instead of the `EXTRACT` operation is incorrectly applied to the `__iso_year` lookup, leading to incorrect query results.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the query optimization process. The optimization incorrectly applies a `BETWEEN` operation for `__iso_year` lookups, which should use the `EXTRACT` operation.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The optimization to use BETWEEN instead of the EXTRACT operation in YearLookup is also registered for the `__iso_year` lookup, which breaks the functionality provided by `ExtractIsoYear` when used via the lookup.\"\n   - \"Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation).\"\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: When filtering using `__iso_year`, the query uses a `BETWEEN` operation instead of `EXTRACT`, leading to incorrect filtering results.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test filtering with `__iso_year` and verify that the query uses `EXTRACT` instead of `BETWEEN`.\n   - Compare results of filtering using `__iso_year` with results from an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear`.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with dates that are at the boundary of ISO years (e.g., last week of December and first week of January).\n   - Test with leap years and non-leap years.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Setup a test database with known dates.\n   - Perform a query using `__iso_year` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Perform a query using an explicit annotation with `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the generated SQL.\n   - Compare the SQL queries to ensure `EXTRACT` is used in both cases.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a test model with a date field.\n   - Populate the model with test data covering various ISO year scenarios.\n\n8. **Relevant Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` contains `EXTRACT('isoyear' FROM ...)`.\n   - Assert that the results of the query match expected results based on the test data.\n\n9. **Plan to Trigger the Bug**:\n   - Use a filter with `__iso_year` and check the generated SQL to ensure it incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n\n10. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that the SQL query uses `BETWEEN` instead of `EXTRACT`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the SQL query now correctly uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a test model with a `DateField`.\n   - Populate the model with dates that span multiple ISO years, including boundary cases.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a queryset to filter using `__iso_year` and capture the SQL query.\n   - Use a queryset with an explicit annotation using `ExtractIsoYear` and capture the SQL query.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Filter the queryset using `__iso_year` and observe the SQL query to check for the use of `BETWEEN`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the model and data.\n   - Execute the filter query using `__iso_year`.\n   - Execute the filter query using an explicit annotation.\n   - Compare the SQL queries generated by both methods.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the SQL query for `__iso_year` incorrectly uses `BETWEEN`.\n   - Assert that the SQL query for the explicit annotation uses `EXTRACT`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Include dates from the last week of December and the first week of January.\n   - Include dates from leap years and non-leap years.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the SQL query for `__iso_year` uses `BETWEEN`, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the SQL query should use `EXTRACT`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\n\n# Define a test model\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpTestData(cls):\n        # Create the table manually since migrations are not applied\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE test_app_dtmodel (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, start_date DATE)')\n\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup_uses_between(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT\n        self.assertIn('BETWEEN', query)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
