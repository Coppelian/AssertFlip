Here's a detailed plan for writing such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django project environment with a version greater than 3.2.3.\n   - Ensure that the TEMPLATES setting in the Django settings file includes a DIRS entry that is an empty string, e.g., `DIRS: ['']`.\n   - Mock or simulate the environment variable `TEMPLATES_DIRS` to return an empty string, which will be split into a list containing an empty string.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a configuration where `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` is set to `['']`.\n   - Ensure that the autoreload mechanism is active and monitoring for changes.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Trigger a file change event in the project directory that would normally cause the autoreload to activate.\n   - This can be done by modifying a non-Python file (e.g., a template file) in the project.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django application with the specified settings.\n   - Start the autoreload mechanism.\n   - Simulate a file change in the project directory.\n   - Observe the behavior of the autoreload mechanism.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the autoreload mechanism does not restart the server when a non-Python file is changed.\n   - Check that the `template_changed` function returns `True` due to the empty string being normalized to the project root.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `TEMPLATES['DIRS']` contains valid directories along with an empty string.\n   - Test with different types of file changes (e.g., template files, static files) to ensure the bug is consistently triggered.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the autoreload mechanism fails to restart the server when a non-Python file is changed, indicating the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as the autoreload mechanism should correctly restart the server upon file changes.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up the conditions that lead to the bug and verifying that the autoreload mechanism behaves incorrectly when the bug is present. The test should pass by confirming the incorrect behavior, thus exposing the bug. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"get_template_directories\", \"path\": \"django/template/autoreload.py\", \"line\": 43}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_ogl25crHBursU6o6MRnQqRBL", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"reset_loaders\", \"path\": \"django/template/autoreload.py\", \"line\": 53}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_38OqEVdHcsp75wIUnRxRhV0l", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_ogl25crHBursU6o6MRnQqRBL", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom pathlib import Path\nfrom django.template import engines\nfrom django.template.backends.django import DjangoTemplates\nfrom django.utils._os import to_path\nfrom django.utils.autoreload import is_django_path\n\ndef get_template_directories():\n    cwd = Path.cwd()\n    items = set()\n    for backend in engines.all():\n        if not isinstance(backend, DjangoTemplates):\n            continue\n        items.update((cwd / to_path(dir) for dir in backend.engine.dirs))\n        for loader in backend.engine.template_loaders:\n            if not hasattr(loader, 'get_dirs'):\n                continue\n            items.update((cwd / to_path(directory) for directory in loader.get_dirs() if not is_django_path(directory)))\n    return items\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_38OqEVdHcsp75wIUnRxRhV0l", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.template import engines\nfrom django.template.backends.django import DjangoTemplates\n\ndef reset_loaders():\n    for backend in engines.all():\n        if not isinstance(backend, DjangoTemplates):\n            continue\n        for loader in backend.engine.template_loaders:\n            loader.reset()\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase, override_settings\nfrom django.utils.autoreload import autoreload_started, file_changed\nfrom django.dispatch import receiver\nimport os\n\nclass TemplateAutoreloadTests(SimpleTestCase):\n\n    @override_settings(TEMPLATES=[{\n        'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n        'DIRS': [''],  # Set DIRS to contain an empty string\n    }])\n    def test_autoreload_with_empty_template_dir(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that autoreload incorrectly triggers when TEMPLATES DIRS contains an empty string.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        # Simulate the environment variable TEMPLATES_DIRS to return an empty string\n        os.environ['TEMPLATES_DIRS'] = ''\n\n        # Start the autoreload mechanism\n        autoreload_triggered = []\n\n        @receiver(autoreload_started)\n        def on_autoreload_started(sender, **kwargs):\n            autoreload_triggered.append(True)\n\n        # Simulate a file change event\n        @receiver(file_changed)\n        def on_file_changed(sender, file_path, **kwargs):\n            # Simulate a non-Python file change\n            if not file_path.endswith('.py'):\n                autoreload_triggered.append(True)\n\n        # Trigger a file change event\n        file_changed.send(sender=self.__class__, file_path='template.html')\n\n        # Assert that the autoreload mechanism incorrectly triggers\n        self.assertTrue(autoreload_triggered, \"BUG: Autoreload should not trigger, but it does due to the empty string in TEMPLATES DIRS.\")\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is related to the autoreload functionality in Django when the TEMPLATES DIRS setting contains an empty string.
