According to the issue ticket, the expected behavior when `evaluate=False` is provided is that the expression should not be evaluated to a boolean value but should instead return a symbolic relational expression. The test code attempts to verify this by asserting that `parse_expr('1 < 2', evaluate=False)` returns `Lt(1, 2, evaluate=False)`, which is the expected symbolic form. The test fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating that the actual output of `parse_expr` does not match the expected symbolic form `Lt(1, 2, evaluate=False)`. This failure directly corresponds to the reported issue that the `evaluate=False` parameter is being ignored, as the output is likely being evaluated to `True` instead of remaining as `1 < 2`. Therefore, the test correctly reproduces the bug described in the issue ticket.", "revealing": true}}
