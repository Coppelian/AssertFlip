This is a logic error in the implementation of the `__repr__` method.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The expected `__repr__` output should be a string like `RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n   - The actual output is a default object representation like `<sklearn.model_selection._split.RepeatedKFold object at 0x...>`.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The `__repr__` method is not overridden in the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, leading to the default object representation being returned.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the `__repr__` output for a default instance of `RepeatedKFold`.\n   - Test the `__repr__` output for a default instance of `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n   - Test the `__repr__` output for instances with custom parameters.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Instances with different `random_state` values.\n   - Instances with different `n_splits` and `n_repeats` values.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize instances of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n   - Capture the `__repr__` output.\n   - Compare the output with the expected string representation.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond creating instances of the classes.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `__repr__` output matches the expected string format.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the necessary classes from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n   - No additional setup is required.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` with default parameters.\n   - Optionally, create instances with custom parameters for additional coverage.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `repr()` function on the instances to trigger the `__repr__` method.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the instances.\n   - Capture the `__repr__` output using `repr()`.\n   - Compare the captured output with the expected string.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `repr(RepeatedKFold())` returns `RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n   - Assert that `repr(RepeatedStratifiedKFold())` returns `RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different `random_state` values.\n   - Test with different `n_splits` and `n_repeats` values to ensure the `__repr__` method handles various configurations.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `__repr__` method is not correctly implemented (i.e., it returns the default object representation).\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the `__repr__` method now returns the expected string representation.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the `__repr__` method for the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, ensuring that the bug is exposed while the test passes.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 807, "prompt_tokens": 3067, "total_tokens": 3874, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

This is a logic error in the implementation of the `__repr__` method.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The expected `__repr__` output should be a string like `RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n   - The actual output is a default object representation like `<sklearn.model_selection._split.RepeatedKFold object at 0x...>`.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The `__repr__` method is not overridden in the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, leading to the default object representation being returned.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the `__repr__` output for a default instance of `RepeatedKFold`.\n   - Test the `__repr__` output for a default instance of `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n   - Test the `__repr__` output for instances with custom parameters.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Instances with different `random_state` values.\n   - Instances with different `n_splits` and `n_repeats` values.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize instances of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n   - Capture the `__repr__` output.\n   - Compare the output with the expected string representation.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond creating instances of the classes.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `__repr__` output matches the expected string format.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the necessary classes from `sklearn.model_selection`.\n   - No additional setup is required.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create instances of `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` with default parameters.\n   - Optionally, create instances with custom parameters for additional coverage.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `repr()` function on the instances to trigger the `__repr__` method.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the instances.\n   - Capture the `__repr__` output using `repr()`.\n   - Compare the captured output with the expected string.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `repr(RepeatedKFold())` returns `RepeatedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n   - Assert that `repr(RepeatedStratifiedKFold())` returns `RepeatedStratifiedKFold(n_splits=5, n_repeats=10, random_state=None)`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different `random_state` values.\n   - Test with different `n_splits` and `n_repeats` values to ensure the `__repr__` method handles various configurations.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `__repr__` method is not correctly implemented (i.e., it returns the default object representation).\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the `__repr__` method now returns the expected string representation.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a comprehensive approach to testing the `__repr__` method for the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes, ensuring that the bug is exposed while the test passes. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"RepeatedKFold\", \"path\": \"sklearn/model_selection/_split.py\", \"line\": 1167}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_wKJWRiBLjZX7elA8LrptxC0U", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"RepeatedStratifiedKFold\", \"path\": \"sklearn/model_selection/_split.py\", \"line\": 1220}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_QTbpO7pSVkc524WiTb5575Sc", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_wKJWRiBLjZX7elA8LrptxC0U", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass RepeatedKFold(_RepeatedSplits):\n    \"\"\"Repeated K-Fold cross validator.\n\n    Repeats K-Fold n times with different randomization in each repetition.\n\n    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    n_splits : int, default=5\n        Number of folds.
