The bug is that the cache is not cleared when a lookup is unregistered, which should be done similarly to how it is handled in the `register_lookup` method.\n\nHere's a detailed plan to write a test that exposes this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure that the `RegisterLookupMixin` class is available for testing.\n   - Prepare a mock or dummy lookup class to register and unregister.\n   - Ensure the environment is isolated to prevent interference from other tests.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - A mock lookup class with a unique `lookup_name`.\n   - An instance of a class that inherits from `RegisterLookupMixin`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Register the mock lookup using `register_lookup`.\n   - Verify that the lookup is cached by calling `get_lookups`.\n   - Unregister the lookup using `_unregister_lookup`.\n   - Attempt to retrieve the lookup again using `get_lookups`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test environment and create necessary objects.\n   - Register the mock lookup and assert it is present in the cache.\n   - Unregister the lookup and check if it is still present in the cache.\n   - The bug is triggered if the lookup is still retrievable after unregistering.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the lookup is present in the cache after registration.\n   - Assert that the lookup is not present in the cache after unregistering (this assertion will pass if the bug is present and fail once the bug is fixed).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with multiple lookups registered and unregistered in sequence.\n   - Test unregistering a lookup that was never registered to ensure no errors occur.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the lookup is still retrievable after being unregistered, indicating the cache was not cleared (exposing the bug).\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail because the lookup will not be retrievable after unregistering, as expected.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure the test to expose the bug in the `_unregister_lookup` method by demonstrating that the cache is not cleared as it should be.

The bug is that the cache is not cleared when a lookup is unregistered, which should be done similarly to how it is handled in the `register_lookup` method.\n\nHere's a detailed plan to write a test that exposes this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure that the `RegisterLookupMixin` class is available for testing.\n   - Prepare a mock or dummy lookup class to register and unregister.\n   - Ensure the environment is isolated to prevent interference from other tests.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - A mock lookup class with a unique `lookup_name`.\n   - An instance of a class that inherits from `RegisterLookupMixin`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Register the mock lookup using `register_lookup`.\n   - Verify that the lookup is cached by calling `get_lookups`.\n   - Unregister the lookup using `_unregister_lookup`.\n   - Attempt to retrieve the lookup again using `get_lookups`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test environment and create necessary objects.\n   - Register the mock lookup and assert it is present in the cache.\n   - Unregister the lookup and check if it is still present in the cache.\n   - The bug is triggered if the lookup is still retrievable after unregistering.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the lookup is present in the cache after registration.\n   - Assert that the lookup is not present in the cache after unregistering (this assertion will pass if the bug is present and fail once the bug is fixed).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with multiple lookups registered and unregistered in sequence.\n   - Test unregistering a lookup that was never registered to ensure no errors occur.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the lookup is still retrievable after being unregistered, indicating the cache was not cleared (exposing the bug).\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail because the lookup will not be retrievable after unregistering, as expected.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure the test to expose the bug in the `_unregister_lookup` method by demonstrating that the cache is not cleared as it should be. The test will pass under the current buggy conditions and will fail once the bug is fixed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"RegisterLookupMixin._unregister_lookup\",\"path\":\"django/db/models/query_utils.py\",\"line\":212}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_PmxGjwvLrKURNHVxUrYgVnwO", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_PmxGjwvLrKURNHVxUrYgVnwO", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass RegisterLookupMixin:\n    ...\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _unregister_lookup(cls, lookup, lookup_name=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Remove given lookup from cls lookups.

The bug is that the cache is not cleared when a lookup is unregistered, which should be done similarly to how it is handled in the `register_lookup` method.\n\nHere's a detailed plan to write a test that exposes this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure that the `RegisterLookupMixin` class is available for testing.\n   - Prepare a mock or dummy lookup class to register and unregister.\n   - Ensure the environment is isolated to prevent interference from other tests.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - A mock lookup class with a unique `lookup_name`.\n   - An instance of a class that inherits from `RegisterLookupMixin`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Register the mock lookup using `register_lookup`.\n   - Verify that the lookup is cached by calling `get_lookups`.\n   - Unregister the lookup using `_unregister_lookup`.\n   - Attempt to retrieve the lookup again using `get_lookups`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test environment and create necessary objects.\n   - Register the mock lookup and assert it is present in the cache.\n   - Unregister the lookup and check if it is still present in the cache.\n   - The bug is triggered if the lookup is still retrievable after unregistering.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the lookup is present in the cache after registration.\n   - Assert that the lookup is not present in the cache after unregistering (this assertion will pass if the bug is present and fail once the bug is fixed).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with multiple lookups registered and unregistered in sequence.\n   - Test unregistering a lookup that was never registered to ensure no errors occur.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the lookup is still retrievable after being unregistered, indicating the cache was not cleared (exposing the bug).\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail because the lookup will not be retrievable after unregistering, as expected.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure the test to expose the bug in the `_unregister_lookup` method by demonstrating that the cache is not cleared as it should be. The test will pass under the current buggy conditions and will fail once the bug is fixed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"RegisterLookupMixin._unregister_lookup\",\"path\":\"django/db/models/query_utils.py\",\"line\":212}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_PmxGjwvLrKURNHVxUrYgVnwO", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_PmxGjwvLrKURNHVxUrYgVnwO", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass RegisterLookupMixin:\n    ...\n\n    @classmethod\n    def _unregister_lookup(cls, lookup, lookup_name=None):\n        \"\"\"\n        Remove given lookup from cls lookups.
