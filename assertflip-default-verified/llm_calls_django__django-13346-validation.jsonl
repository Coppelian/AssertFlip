The test sets up a model with a JSONField and inserts data where the 'key' has a value of 0 in three instances and 1 in one instance. The test then attempts to filter using the __in lookup on the key transform and expects to retrieve three items, which matches the behavior described in the issue ticket. However, the test fails because the __in lookup returns 0 items instead of the expected 3, which aligns with the reported bug. The control test without the __in lookup works as expected, returning 3 items, further confirming the issue. Therefore, the test correctly reproduces the bug and is a valid test case.", "revealing": true}}
