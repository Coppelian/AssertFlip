The goal is to ensure that the test passes but still highlights the bug, which is the absence of the field name in the error message.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the error message construction for `readonly_fields` in the `ModelAdmin` class. The error message does not include the field name, which makes it less informative compared to other similar checks.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The value of 'readonly_fields[0]' is not a callable, an attribute of 'CityInline', or an attribute of 'admin_checks.City'.\"\n   - The error message should include the field name for better clarity.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: The error message for `readonly_fields` should include the field name but currently only includes the index.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - A test case where `readonly_fields` contains a field name that does not exist in the model or is not callable.\n   - Compare the error message format with other fields like `list_editable` to ensure consistency.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - `readonly_fields` is empty.\n   - `readonly_fields` contains valid field names.\n   - `readonly_fields` contains a mix of valid and invalid field names.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Set up a mock `ModelAdmin` with a `readonly_fields` list containing an invalid field name.\n   - Trigger the check that generates the error message.\n   - Capture the error message and verify its format.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a mock model and a mock `ModelAdmin` class.\n   - Define `readonly_fields` with at least one invalid field name.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the error message is generated.\n   - Assert that the error message includes the index but not the field name (to expose the bug).\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a mock model class with a few fields.\n   - Create a mock `ModelAdmin` class with a `readonly_fields` attribute containing an invalid field name.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a `readonly_fields` list with at least one field name that does not exist in the model.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `check` method on the `ModelAdmin` instance to trigger the error message generation for `readonly_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the mock model and `ModelAdmin`.\n   - Set `readonly_fields` with an invalid field name.\n   - Invoke the `check` method to generate the error message.\n   - Capture the error message output.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the error message is generated.\n   - Assert that the error message includes the index (e.g., 'readonly_fields[0]') but not the field name.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with an empty `readonly_fields`.\n   - Test with all valid field names in `readonly_fields`.\n   - Test with a mix of valid and invalid field names.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the error message includes the index but not the field name, thus exposing the bug. Once the bug is fixed to include the field name, the test should be updated to reflect the correct behavior and fail if the bug reappears.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan ensures that the test will highlight the missing field name in the error message for `readonly_fields`, aligning with the issue described in the ticket. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"ModelAdminChecks.check\", \"path\": \"django/contrib/admin/checks.py\", \"line\": 789}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_V42zCe1ZBkaq8e1Za7SvghHh", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BaseModelAdminChecks._check_readonly_fields_item\", \"path\": \"django/contrib/admin/checks.py\", \"line\": 761}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_C3qpx9iJ1zAVxjHoEeLplODw", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_V42zCe1ZBkaq8e1Za7SvghHh", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass ModelAdminChecks(BaseModelAdminChecks):\n    ...\n\n    def check(self, admin_obj, **kwargs):\n        return [*super().check(admin_obj), *self._check_save_as(admin_obj), *self._check_save_on_top(admin_obj), *self._check_inlines(admin_obj), *self._check_list_display(admin_obj), *self._check_list_display_links(admin_obj), *self._check_list_filter(admin_obj), *self._check_list_select_related(admin_obj), *self._check_list_per_page(admin_obj), *self._check_list_max_show_all(admin_obj), *self._check_list_editable(admin_obj), *self._check_search_fields(admin_obj), *self._check_date_hierarchy(admin_obj), *self._check_action_permission_methods(admin_obj), *self._check_actions_uniqueness(admin_obj)]\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_C3qpx9iJ1zAVxjHoEeLplODw", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.core import checks\nfrom django.core.exceptions import FieldDoesNotExist\n\nclass BaseModelAdminChecks:\n    ...\n\n    def _check_readonly_fields_item(self, obj, field_name, label):\n        if callable(field_name):\n            return []\n        elif hasattr(obj, field_name):\n            return []\n        elif hasattr(obj.model, field_name):\n            return []\n        else:\n            try:\n                obj.model._meta.get_field(field_name)\n            except FieldDoesNotExist:\n                return [checks.Error(\"The value of '%s' is not a callable, an attribute of '%s', or an attribute of '%s'.\" % (label, obj.__class__.__name__, obj.model._meta.label), obj=obj.__class__, id='admin.E035')]\n            else:\n                return []\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.contrib.admin import ModelAdmin\nfrom django.core import checks\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MockModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\nclass MockModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):\n    model = MockModel\n    readonly_fields = ['non_existent_field']\n\nclass ReadonlyFieldsErrorMessageTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_readonly_fields_error_message(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that the error message for readonly_fields does not include the field name.\n        This test passes because the current behavior is incorrect and does not include the field name.\n        \"\"\"\n        admin_obj = MockModelAdmin(MockModel, admin_site=None)\n        errors = admin_obj.check()\n\n        # Find the specific error related to readonly_fields\n        readonly_fields_error = next(\n            (error for error in errors if error.id == 'admin.E035'), None\n        )\n\n        self.assertIsNotNone(readonly_fields_error, \"Expected an error related to readonly_fields.\")\n        self.assertIn(\"readonly_fields[0]\", readonly_fields_error.msg)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"non_existent_field\", readonly_fields_error.msg)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe information retrieved confirms the logic in the `_check_readonly_fields_item` method, which constructs the error message without including the field name, only the index.

The goal is to ensure that the test passes but still highlights the bug, which is the absence of the field name in the error message.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the error message construction for `readonly_fields` in the `ModelAdmin` class. The error message does not include the field name, which makes it less informative compared to other similar checks.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The value of 'readonly_fields[0]' is not a callable, an attribute of 'CityInline', or an attribute of 'admin_checks.City'.\"\n   - The error message should include the field name for better clarity.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: The error message for `readonly_fields` should include the field name but currently only includes the index.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - A test case where `readonly_fields` contains a field name that does not exist in the model or is not callable.\n   - Compare the error message format with other fields like `list_editable` to ensure consistency.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - `readonly_fields` is empty.\n   - `readonly_fields` contains valid field names.\n   - `readonly_fields` contains a mix of valid and invalid field names.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Set up a mock `ModelAdmin` with a `readonly_fields` list containing an invalid field name.\n   - Trigger the check that generates the error message.\n   - Capture the error message and verify its format.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a mock model and a mock `ModelAdmin` class.\n   - Define `readonly_fields` with at least one invalid field name.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the error message is generated.\n   - Assert that the error message includes the index but not the field name (to expose the bug).\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a mock model class with a few fields.\n   - Create a mock `ModelAdmin` class with a `readonly_fields` attribute containing an invalid field name.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a `readonly_fields` list with at least one field name that does not exist in the model.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `check` method on the `ModelAdmin` instance to trigger the error message generation for `readonly_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the mock model and `ModelAdmin`.\n   - Set `readonly_fields` with an invalid field name.\n   - Invoke the `check` method to generate the error message.\n   - Capture the error message output.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the error message is generated.\n   - Assert that the error message includes the index (e.g., 'readonly_fields[0]') but not the field name.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with an empty `readonly_fields`.\n   - Test with all valid field names in `readonly_fields`.\n   - Test with a mix of valid and invalid field names.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the error message includes the index but not the field name, thus exposing the bug. Once the bug is fixed to include the field name, the test should be updated to reflect the correct behavior and fail if the bug reappears.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan ensures that the test will highlight the missing field name in the error message for `readonly_fields`, aligning with the issue described in the ticket. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.contrib.admin import ModelAdmin\nfrom django.core import checks\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.apps import apps, AppConfig\n\nclass TestAppConfig(AppConfig):\n    name = 'test_app'\n    label = 'test_app'\n\napps.app_configs[TestAppConfig.label] = TestAppConfig('test_app', 'test_app')\napps.clear_cache()\n\nclass MockModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass MockModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):\n    model = MockModel\n    readonly_fields = ['non_existent_field']\n\nclass ReadonlyFieldsErrorMessageTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_readonly_fields_error_message(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that the error message for readonly_fields does not include the field name.\n        This test passes because the current behavior is incorrect and does not include the field name.\n        \"\"\"\n        admin_obj = MockModelAdmin(MockModel, admin_site=None)\n        errors = admin_obj.check()\n\n        # Find the specific error related to readonly_fields\n        readonly_fields_error = next(\n            (error for error in errors if error.id == 'admin.E035'), None\n        )\n\n        self.assertIsNotNone(readonly_fields_error, \"Expected an error related to readonly_fields.\")\n        self.assertIn(\"readonly_fields[0]\", readonly_fields_error.msg)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"non_existent_field\", readonly_fields_error.msg)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The goal is to ensure that the test passes but still highlights the bug, which is the absence of the field name in the error message.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: This is a logic error in the error message construction for `readonly_fields` in the `ModelAdmin` class. The error message does not include the field name, which makes it less informative compared to other similar checks.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"The value of 'readonly_fields[0]' is not a callable, an attribute of 'CityInline', or an attribute of 'admin_checks.City'.\"\n   - The error message should include the field name for better clarity.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**: The error message for `readonly_fields` should include the field name but currently only includes the index.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - A test case where `readonly_fields` contains a field name that does not exist in the model or is not callable.\n   - Compare the error message format with other fields like `list_editable` to ensure consistency.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - `readonly_fields` is empty.\n   - `readonly_fields` contains valid field names.\n   - `readonly_fields` contains a mix of valid and invalid field names.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Set up a mock `ModelAdmin` with a `readonly_fields` list containing an invalid field name.\n   - Trigger the check that generates the error message.\n   - Capture the error message and verify its format.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - Create a mock model and a mock `ModelAdmin` class.\n   - Define `readonly_fields` with at least one invalid field name.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the error message is generated.\n   - Assert that the error message includes the index but not the field name (to expose the bug).\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a mock model class with a few fields.\n   - Create a mock `ModelAdmin` class with a `readonly_fields` attribute containing an invalid field name.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a `readonly_fields` list with at least one field name that does not exist in the model.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `check` method on the `ModelAdmin` instance to trigger the error message generation for `readonly_fields`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the mock model and `ModelAdmin`.\n   - Set `readonly_fields` with an invalid field name.\n   - Invoke the `check` method to generate the error message.\n   - Capture the error message output.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the error message is generated.\n   - Assert that the error message includes the index (e.g., 'readonly_fields[0]') but not the field name.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with an empty `readonly_fields`.\n   - Test with all valid field names in `readonly_fields`.\n   - Test with a mix of valid and invalid field names.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the error message includes the index but not the field name, thus exposing the bug. Once the bug is fixed to include the field name, the test should be updated to reflect the correct behavior and fail if the bug reappears.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan ensures that the test will highlight the missing field name in the error message for `readonly_fields`, aligning with the issue described in the ticket. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.contrib.admin import ModelAdmin\nfrom django.core import checks\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass MockModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass MockModelAdmin(ModelAdmin):\n    model = MockModel\n    readonly_fields = ['non_existent_field']\n\nclass ReadonlyFieldsErrorMessageTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_readonly_fields_error_message(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that the error message for readonly_fields does not include the field name.\n        This test passes because the current behavior is incorrect and does not include the field name.\n        \"\"\"\n        admin_obj = MockModelAdmin(MockModel, admin_site=None)\n        errors = admin_obj.check()\n\n        # Find the specific error related to readonly_fields\n        readonly_fields_error = next(\n            (error for error in errors if error.id == 'admin.E035'), None\n        )\n\n        self.assertIsNotNone(readonly_fields_error, \"Expected an error related to readonly_fields.\")\n        self.assertIn(\"readonly_fields[0]\", readonly_fields_error.msg)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"non_existent_field\", readonly_fields_error.msg)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
