Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

The issue is that the function returns a redirect to `'%s/' % request.path_info` instead of `'%s/' % request.path`, which should include the script name.\n\nLet's break down the plan:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure that the Django settings are configured to use `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`. This involves setting `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` to a non-None value, such as `'/myapp'`.\n   - Configure a test client or mock request object that simulates a request with a script name.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a mock request object with `path` and `path_info` attributes. The `path` should include the script name, while `path_info` should not.\n   - Example: If `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` is `'/myapp'`, then `request.path` should be `'/myapp/some/path'` and `request.path_info` should be `'/some/path'`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `catch_all_view()` function with the mock request object.\n   - The function should attempt to redirect using `request.path_info`, which will not include the script name, thus triggering the bug.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Set up the Django environment with the necessary settings.\n   - Create the mock request object with the specified `path` and `path_info`.\n   - Invoke the `catch_all_view()` function with the mock request.\n   - Capture the redirect URL returned by the function.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the redirect URL is based on `request.path` and not `request.path_info`.\n   - Specifically, check that the redirect URL includes the script name as specified in `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider cases where `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` is set to an empty string or a root path (`'/'`).\n   - Test with different values of `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the redirect URL includes the script name, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as the redirect URL will correctly include the script name.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to set up the test environment, create the necessary input, and structure the test to expose the bug related to the `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` setting in the `catch_all_view()` function. The assertions are designed to pass when the bug is present, ensuring the test serves as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"catch_all_view\", \"path\": \"path/to/catch_all_view.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_X3OtE8vh8w8p2jYdVbi32wmT", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"catch_all_view\", \"path\": \"path/to/catch_all_view.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_r3KQsqfD4bIdXUDAwRi7xrJI", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_X3OtE8vh8w8p2jYdVbi32wmT", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on catch_all_view.\n\nFile /testbed/path/to/catch_all_view.py does not exist."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_r3KQsqfD4bIdXUDAwRi7xrJI", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on catch_all_view.\n\nFile /testbed/path/to/catch_all_view.py does not exist."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase, override_settings\nfrom django.http import HttpRequest\nfrom django.urls import reverse\n\nclass CatchAllViewTest(TestCase):\n    @override_settings(FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME='/myapp')\n    def test_catch_all_view_redirect(self):\n        # Create a mock request object\n        request = HttpRequest()\n        request.path = '/myapp/some/path'\n        request.path_info = '/some/path'\n\n        # Simulate calling the catch_all_view function\n        # Assuming catch_all_view is a view function that returns a redirect response\n        response = self.client.get(reverse('catch_all_view'), PATH_INFO=request.path_info)\n\n        # Check the redirect URL\n        expected_redirect_url = '/myapp/some/path/'\n        actual_redirect_url = response.url\n\n        # Assert that the redirect URL is incorrect due to the bug\n        self.assertEqual(expected_redirect_url, actual_redirect_url)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe PLAN outlines a strategy to test the `catch_all_view()` function's handling of the `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` setting.
