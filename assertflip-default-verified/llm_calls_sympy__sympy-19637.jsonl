This error occurs in the `kernS` function from the `sympy.core.sympify` module. Let's analyze the problem and plan a test to expose this bug.\n\n### Analysis\n\n1. **Type of Bug**: \n   - The bug is an `UnboundLocalError`, which is an exception that occurs when a local variable is referenced before it has been assigned a value.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The error message: `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'kern' referenced before assignment`.\n   - The code snippet causing the error: `expr = kernS(text)` where `text = \"(2*x)/(x-1)\"`.\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The `kernS` function contains logic that attempts to create a unique `kern` string if a space is present in `s` (line 510-515).\n   - The variable `hit` is set based on whether `kern` is in `s` (line 516).\n   - The error likely occurs if the condition `if ' ' in s:` is not met, and `kern` is never initialized before being used in `hit = kern in s`.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function `kernS` will throw an `UnboundLocalError` when `kern` is referenced without being initialized.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test with input strings that do not contain spaces, such as `\"(2*x)/(x-1)\"`, to trigger the bug.\n   - Test with input strings that contain spaces to ensure `kern` is initialized.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Strings with no spaces.\n   - Strings with spaces.\n   - Strings with special characters or nested parentheses.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. **Test Setup**:\n   - Import the `kernS` function from the `sympy.core.sympify` module.\n\n2. **Test Input**:\n   - Use a string input like `\"(2*x)/(x-1)\"` which does not contain spaces.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering**:\n   - Call `kernS` with the input string that lacks spaces to ensure the condition `if ' ' in s:` is false, leading to `kern` not being initialized.\n\n4. **Test Structure**:\n   - Define a test function.\n   - Call `kernS` with the test input.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised during the call.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Assert that an `UnboundLocalError` is raised when `kernS` is called with the input string.\n   - Ensure the test passes by catching the exception and asserting its type.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Consider additional tests with strings containing spaces to verify normal behavior.\n   - Test with strings that have varying lengths and characters.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the `UnboundLocalError` is raised, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as the error should no longer occur.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the `UnboundLocalError` by using an input that does not trigger the initialization of `kern`, thus revealing the bug. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"kernS\",\"path\":\"sympy/core/sympify.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_1X3TjXZoQjpbuxLGYYTf3Zes", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_1X3TjXZoQjpbuxLGYYTf3Zes", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\ndef kernS(s):\n    \"\"\"Use a hack to try keep autosimplification from distributing a\n    a number into an Add;
