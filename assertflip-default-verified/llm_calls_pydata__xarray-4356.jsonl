Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules (`xarray`).\n   - Create a `DataArray` with more than one dimension.\n\n2.

Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `sum` method on the `DataArray` with `min_count` and multiple dimensions to trigger the `ValueError`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the `DataArray`.\n   - Call the `sum` method with `min_count` and multiple dimensions.\n   - Catch the `ValueError` to confirm the bug is triggered.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `ValueError` is raised with the expected message.\n   - Ensure the test passes by confirming the exception is expected behavior for the current buggy state.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with a single dimension to ensure no error is raised.\n   - Test with `min_count=0` to check for different behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `ValueError` is raised when using `min_count` with multiple dimensions, confirming the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should be updated to expect no exception, and it should fail until the fix is verified.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will pass by confirming the current buggy behavior (raising a `ValueError`), and it will need to be updated once the bug is fixed to ensure the correct behavior is achieved.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 718, "prompt_tokens": 3722, "total_tokens": 4440, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

Specifically, a `ValueError` is raised when attempting to use the `sum` function with `min_count` on more than one dimension.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue is described as: \"`sum` with `min_count` errors when passing more than one dim\".\n   - The error message is: \"min_count is not available for reduction with more than one dimensions.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The function `_maybe_null_out` in `xarray/core/nanops.py` raises a `ValueError` if `axis` is a tuple or list (indicating multiple dimensions): \n     ```python\n     if hasattr(axis, \"__len__\"):  # if tuple or list\n         raise ValueError(\n             \"min_count is not available for reduction with more than one dimensions.\"\n         )\n     ```\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When calling `sum` with `min_count` on multiple dimensions, a `ValueError` is raised, which is not the desired behavior.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test calling `sum` with `min_count` on a 2D `DataArray` with two dimensions specified.\n   - Test calling `sum` with `min_count` on a 3D `DataArray` with more than one dimension specified.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with a single dimension to ensure it does not raise an error.\n   - Test with `min_count=0` to see if it behaves differently.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules (`xarray`).\n   - Create a `DataArray` with more than one dimension.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a 2D `DataArray` with known values.\n   - Specify multiple dimensions for the `sum` function.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `sum` method on the `DataArray` with `min_count` and multiple dimensions to trigger the `ValueError`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the `DataArray`.\n   - Call the `sum` method with `min_count` and multiple dimensions.\n   - Catch the `ValueError` to confirm the bug is triggered.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `ValueError` is raised with the expected message.\n   - Ensure the test passes by confirming the exception is expected behavior for the current buggy state.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with a single dimension to ensure no error is raised.\n   - Test with `min_count=0` to check for different behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `ValueError` is raised when using `min_count` with multiple dimensions, confirming the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should be updated to expect no exception, and it should fail until the fix is verified.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will pass by confirming the current buggy behavior (raising a `ValueError`), and it will need to be updated once the bug is fixed to ensure the correct behavior is achieved. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"_maybe_null_out\",\"path\":\"xarray/core/nanops.py\",\"line\":25}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_V574m1Vr2pIIqmDjZD3TDaNv", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_V574m1Vr2pIIqmDjZD3TDaNv", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport numpy as np\nfrom xarray.core import dtypes\n\ndef _maybe_null_out(result, axis, mask, min_count=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    xarray version of pandas.core.nanops._maybe_null_out\n    \"\"\"\n    if hasattr(axis, '__len__'):\n        raise ValueError('min_count is not available for reduction with more than one dimensions.')\n    if axis is not None and getattr(result, 'ndim', False):\n        null_mask = mask.shape[axis] - mask.sum(axis) - min_count < 0\n        if null_mask.any():\n            dtype, fill_value = dtypes.maybe_promote(result.dtype)\n            result = result.astype(dtype)\n            result[null_mask] = fill_value\n    elif getattr(result, 'dtype', None) not in dtypes.NAT_TYPES:\n        null_mask = mask.size - mask.sum()\n        if null_mask < min_count:\n            result = np.nan\n    return result\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brk4EiYfMXZx7iLZti5mddN6FP5T3", "created": 1752148166, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nimport xarray as xr\n\ndef test_sum_with_min_count_multiple_dimensions():\n    # Create a 2D DataArray\n    da = xr.DataArray([[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]], dims=[\"dim_0\", \"dim_1\"])\n    \n    # Attempt to sum over multiple dimensions with min_count\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=\"min_count is not available for reduction with more than one dimensions.\"):\n        # This should raise a ValueError due to the bug\n        da.sum(dim=[\"dim_0\", \"dim_1\"], min_count=1)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe function `_maybe_null_out` in `xarray/core/nanops.py` raises a `ValueError` when the `axis` parameter is a tuple or list, indicating multiple dimensions.

Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('sum: min_count is not available for reduction with more than one dimensions\\n**Is your feature request related to a problem?
