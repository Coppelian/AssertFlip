It does not perform a deep copy of the `error_messages` dictionary, leading to shared state across different instances of form fields.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts**:\n   - From the ISSUE TICKET: \"The `__deepcopy__` method defined for the formfields performs a shallow copy of self and does not include additional treatment for the `error_messages` dictionary.\"\n   - From the CODE SNIPPETS: \n     - The `__deepcopy__` method in `django/forms/fields.py` at line 198 does not handle `error_messages`.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - Modifying the `error_messages` of one form field instance affects all other instances that were deep-copied from it.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Create a form field, perform a deep copy, modify the `error_messages` in the copied field, and check if the original field's `error_messages` are also modified.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Test with empty `error_messages`.\n   - Test with multiple fields in a form to ensure isolation.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. **Test Setup**:\n   - Create a form field with a custom `error_messages` dictionary.\n   - Use the `copy.deepcopy` method to create a copy of the form field.\n\n2. **Test Input**:\n   - A form field instance with a non-empty `error_messages` dictionary.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering**:\n   - Modify the `error_messages` dictionary in the copied form field.\n   - Check if the original form field's `error_messages` dictionary remains unchanged.\n\n4. **Test Structure**:\n   - Initialize a form field with specific `error_messages`.\n   - Perform a deep copy of the form field.\n   - Modify the `error_messages` in the copied field.\n   - Assert that the original field's `error_messages` have not changed.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Assert that the `error_messages` of the original field are not affected by changes in the copied field.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Test with an empty `error_messages` dictionary to ensure no errors occur.\n   - Test with multiple fields in a form to ensure each field's `error_messages` are isolated.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as the original field's `error_messages` will be incorrectly modified. Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the `error_messages` are correctly isolated.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug in the `__deepcopy__` method of form fields, focusing on the shared state of the `error_messages` dictionary. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Field.__deepcopy__\",\"path\":\"django/forms/fields.py\",\"line\":198}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_iFZzlyiBNz1Q4L3QJK7vaFaV", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_iFZzlyiBNz1Q4L3QJK7vaFaV", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport copy\n\nclass Field:\n    ...\n\n    def __deepcopy__(self, memo):\n        result = copy.copy(self)\n        memo[id(self)] = result\n        result.widget = copy.deepcopy(self.widget, memo)\n        result.validators = self.validators[:]\n        return result\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brdt4khJEfWofCYtvq9mTlLvchNSk", "created": 1752124410, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nimport copy\nfrom django.forms import CharField\n\nclass FieldDeepCopyTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_deepcopy_error_messages(self):\n        # Create a CharField with custom error messages\n        original_field = CharField(error_messages={'required': 'This field is required.'})\n\n        # Perform a deep copy of the original field\n        copied_field = copy.deepcopy(original_field)\n\n        # Modify the error_messages in the copied field\n        copied_field.error_messages['required'] = 'This field is absolutely required.'\n\n        # Assert that the original field's error_messages have changed\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertEqual(\n            original_field.error_messages['required'],\n            'This field is absolutely required.'\n        )\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe bug is in the `__deepcopy__` method of the `Field` class, which does not perform a deep copy of the `error_messages` dictionary.
