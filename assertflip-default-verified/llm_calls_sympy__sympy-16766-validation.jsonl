The issue ticket describes a problem where the `pycode` function outputs a warning comment indicating that `Indexed` is not supported. The test code creates an `IndexedBase` object `p` and attempts to convert `p[0]` to Python code using `pycode`. It then asserts that the result should be \"p[0]\", which is the expected correct output without any warnings. The test fails because the assertion does not hold, indicating that the `pycode` function still produces the warning or an incorrect output. This failure is consistent with the reported issue, as the `pycode` function does not yet support `Indexed` objects properly. Therefore, the test correctly reproduces the bug and is a valid test case.", "revealing": true}}
