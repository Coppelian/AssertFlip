The test will pass under the current buggy implementation and fail once the bug is addressed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"nthroot_mod\",\"path\":\"sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py\",\"line\":746}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_5e5q4EL28mS4nGfuiPLhhLWm", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_5e5q4EL28mS4nGfuiPLhhLWm", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import as_int\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import igcdex\nfrom sympy.ntheory.primetest import isprime\n\ndef nthroot_mod(a, n, p, all_roots=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the solutions to ``x**n = a mod p``\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    a : integer\n    n : positive integer\n    p : positive integer\n    all_roots : if False returns the smallest root, else the list of roots\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory import nthroot_mod\n    >>> nthroot_mod(11, 4, 19)\n    8\n    >>> nthroot_mod(11, 4, 19, True)\n    [8, 11]\n    >>> nthroot_mod(68, 3, 109)\n    23\n    \"\"\"\n    from sympy.core.numbers import igcdex\n    a, n, p = (as_int(a), as_int(n), as_int(p))\n    if n == 2:\n        return sqrt_mod(a, p, all_roots)\n    if not is_nthpow_residue(a, n, p):\n        return None\n    if not isprime(p):\n        raise NotImplementedError('Not implemented for composite p')\n    if (p - 1) % n == 0:\n        return _nthroot_mod1(a, n, p, all_roots)\n    pa = n\n    pb = p - 1\n    b = 1\n    if pa < pb:\n        a, pa, b, pb = (b, pb, a, pa)\n    while pb:\n        q, r = divmod(pa, pb)\n        c = pow(b, q, p)\n        c = igcdex(c, p)[0]\n        c = c * a % p\n        pa, pb = (pb, r)\n        a, b = (b, c)\n    if pa == 1:\n        if all_roots:\n            res = [a]\n        else:\n            res = a\n    elif pa == 2:\n        return sqrt_mod(a, p, all_roots)\n    else:\n        res = _nthroot_mod1(a, pa, p, all_roots)\n    return res\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brm9qWEKPCznEDygMRYpDqGdbHrvj", "created": 1752156202, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.pytest import XFAIL\nfrom sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory import nthroot_mod\n\n@XFAIL\ndef test_nthroot_mod_missing_zero_root():\n    # Test input where a % p == 0\n    roots = nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)\n    # BUG: 0 should be in the list of roots but is currently missing due to the bug\n    assert 0 not in roots\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe `nthroot_mod` function is designed to find solutions to the equation `x**n = a mod p`.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure the `nthroot_mod` function is imported from the `sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory` module.\n   - No additional setup is required as the function operates on integer inputs.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the specific input mentioned in the issue: `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)`.\n   - This input is chosen because `a = 17*17` is a multiple of `p = 17`, hence `a % p == 0`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `a % p == 0`, and the function should return `0 mod p` as one of the roots.\n   - The current implementation does not check for this condition, leading to the bug.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call the `nthroot_mod` function with the test input.\n   - Capture the output, which should be a list of roots if `all_roots=True`.\n   - Check if `0` is included in the list of roots.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `0` is in the list of roots returned by `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n   - This assertion will pass if the bug is present (i.e., `0` is not included), and it will fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `a` is a multiple of `p` for different values of `n` and `p`.\n   - Test with `n = 1` and `n = p-1` to ensure the function handles these edge cases correctly.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the assertion will not be met (i.e., `0` is not in the list of roots).\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now correctly includes `0 mod p` as a root when `a % p == 0`.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that exposes the bug in the `nthroot_mod` function by checking for the missing root `0 mod p` when `a % p == 0`.

Test with `a = 17*17`, `n = 5`, `p = 17` and check for `0 mod 17`.\n   2. Test with other values where `a % p == 0` to ensure consistency.\n   3. Test with `n = 1` and `n = p-1` to cover edge cases.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use inputs where `a % p == 0`.\n   2. Ensure `all_roots=True` to get a list of all potential roots.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to directly check if `0` is included in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The test should check for the presence of `0` in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n   - The test should pass if the bug is present (i.e., `0` is missing) and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import the `nthroot_mod` function.\n   - Input: Use `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n   - Assertions: Check that `0` is in the list of roots.\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different values of `n` and `p`.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1.

Ensure `all_roots=True` to get a list of all potential roots.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to directly check if `0` is included in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The test should check for the presence of `0` in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n   - The test should pass if the bug is present (i.e., `0` is missing) and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import the `nthroot_mod` function.\n   - Input: Use `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n   - Assertions: Check that `0` is in the list of roots.\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different values of `n` and `p`.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `nthroot_mod` function from the `sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory` module.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the input `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `a % p == 0`, and the function should return `0 mod p` as one of the roots.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call the `nthroot_mod` function with the test input.\n   - Capture the output, which should be a list of roots.\n   - Check if `0` is included in the list of roots.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `0` is in the list of roots returned by `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with variations where `a` is a multiple of `p` for different values of `n` and `p`.\n   - Consider `n = 1` and `n = p-1` to ensure the function handles these edge cases correctly.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because `0` will not be in the list of roots.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now correctly includes `0 mod p` as a root when `a % p == 0`.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"nthroot_mod\", \"path\": \"sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py\", \"line\": 746}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_ct7JMKD4wRr0c9ShrjojfFJN", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"_nthroot_mod1\", \"path\": \"sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_qYRuZabIiAhpmArqT5uk6HR6", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_ct7JMKD4wRr0c9ShrjojfFJN", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import as_int\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import igcdex\nfrom sympy.ntheory.primetest import isprime\n\ndef nthroot_mod(a, n, p, all_roots=False):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the solutions to ``x**n = a mod p``\n\n    Parameters\n    ==========\n\n    a : integer\n    n : positive integer\n    p : positive integer\n    all_roots : if False returns the smallest root, else the list of roots\n\n    Examples\n    ========\n\n    >>> from sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory import nthroot_mod\n    >>> nthroot_mod(11, 4, 19)\n    8\n    >>> nthroot_mod(11, 4, 19, True)\n    [8, 11]\n    >>> nthroot_mod(68, 3, 109)\n    23\n    \"\"\"\n    from sympy.core.numbers import igcdex\n    a, n, p = (as_int(a), as_int(n), as_int(p))\n    if n == 2:\n        return sqrt_mod(a, p, all_roots)\n    if not is_nthpow_residue(a, n, p):\n        return None\n    if not isprime(p):\n        raise NotImplementedError('Not implemented for composite p')\n    if (p - 1) % n == 0:\n        return _nthroot_mod1(a, n, p, all_roots)\n    pa = n\n    pb = p - 1\n    b = 1\n    if pa < pb:\n        a, pa, b, pb = (b, pb, a, pa)\n    while pb:\n        q, r = divmod(pa, pb)\n        c = pow(b, q, p)\n        c = igcdex(c, p)[0]\n        c = c * a % p\n        pa, pb = (pb, r)\n        a, b = (b, c)\n    if pa == 1:\n        if all_roots:\n            res = [a]\n        else:\n            res = a\n    elif pa == 2:\n        return sqrt_mod(a, p, all_roots)\n    else:\n        res = _nthroot_mod1(a, pa, p, all_roots)\n    return res\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_qYRuZabIiAhpmArqT5uk6HR6", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.compatibility import range\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import igcdex\nfrom sympy.ntheory.primetest import isprime\n\ndef _nthroot_mod1(s, q, p, all_roots):\n    \"\"\"\n    Root of ``x**q = s mod p``, ``p`` prime and ``q`` divides ``p - 1``\n\n    References\n    ==========\n\n    ..

Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that the `nthroot_mod` function does not return `0 mod p` as a root when `a % p == 0`.\n   - The specific example given is `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)`, where `0 mod 17` should be a root.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The function `nthroot_mod` is defined to find solutions to `x**n = a mod p`.\n   - The function checks if `a` is an `n`-th power residue modulo `p` and handles different cases based on the value of `n`.\n   - The code does not explicitly handle the case where `a % p == 0`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The test was incorrectly designed to assert that `0` is not in the list of roots, which is the opposite of what is needed.\n   - The use of `XFAIL` was inappropriate because the test should fail when the bug is present, not pass.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test never failed, which is expected because the assertion was inverted.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with `a = 17*17`, `n = 5`, `p = 17` and check for `0 mod 17`.\n   2. Test with other values where `a % p == 0` to ensure consistency.\n   3. Test with `n = 1` and `n = p-1` to cover edge cases.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use inputs where `a % p == 0`.\n   2. Ensure `all_roots=True` to get a list of all potential roots.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to directly check if `0` is included in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The test should check for the presence of `0` in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n   - The test should pass if the bug is present (i.e., `0` is missing) and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import the `nthroot_mod` function.\n   - Input: Use `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n   - Assertions: Check that `0` is in the list of roots.\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different values of `n` and `p`.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `nthroot_mod` function from the `sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory` module.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the input `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `a % p == 0`, and the function should return `0 mod p` as one of the roots.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call the `nthroot_mod` function with the test input.\n   - Capture the output, which should be a list of roots.\n   - Check if `0` is included in the list of roots.\n\n5.

Let's analyze the problem and create a detailed plan for writing the test.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is that the `nthroot_mod` function does not return `0 mod p` as a root when `a % p == 0`.\n   - The specific example given is `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)`, where `0 mod 17` should be a root.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The function `nthroot_mod` is defined to find solutions to `x**n = a mod p`.\n   - The function checks if `a` is an `n`-th power residue modulo `p` and handles different cases based on the value of `n`.\n   - The code does not explicitly handle the case where `a % p == 0`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The test was incorrectly designed to assert that `0` is not in the list of roots, which is the opposite of what is needed.\n   - The use of `XFAIL` was inappropriate because the test should fail when the bug is present, not pass.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error indicates that the test never failed, which is expected because the assertion was inverted.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with `a = 17*17`, `n = 5`, `p = 17` and check for `0 mod 17`.\n   2. Test with other values where `a % p == 0` to ensure consistency.\n   3. Test with `n = 1` and `n = p-1` to cover edge cases.\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use inputs where `a % p == 0`.\n   2. Ensure `all_roots=True` to get a list of all potential roots.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to directly check if `0` is included in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The test should check for the presence of `0` in the list of roots when `a % p == 0`.\n   - The test should pass if the bug is present (i.e., `0` is missing) and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import the `nthroot_mod` function.\n   - Input: Use `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n   - Assertions: Check that `0` is in the list of roots.\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different values of `n` and `p`.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `nthroot_mod` function from the `sympy.ntheory.residue_ntheory` module.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the input `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `a % p == 0`, and the function should return `0 mod p` as one of the roots.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Call the `nthroot_mod` function with the test input.\n   - Capture the output, which should be a list of roots.\n   - Check if `0` is included in the list of roots.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that `0` is in the list of roots returned by `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17, all_roots=True)`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with variations where `a` is a multiple of `p` for different values of `n` and `p`.\n   - Consider `n = 1` and `n = p-1` to ensure the function handles these edge cases correctly.\n\n7.
