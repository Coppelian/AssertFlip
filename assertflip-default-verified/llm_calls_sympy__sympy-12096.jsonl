It fails to recursively evaluate the function when composed functions are involved.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue is described as: \"evalf does not call _imp_ recursively.\"\n   - Example provided: \n     ```python\n     >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n     >>> f = implemented_function('f', lambda x: x ** 2)\n     >>> g = implemented_function('g', lambda x: 2 * x)\n     >>> print(f(g(2)).evalf())\n     f(g(2))\n     ```\n   - The expected behavior is that `f(g(2)).evalf()` should evaluate to `16.00000000000000`, but it returns `f(g(2))`.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function `evalf` does not evaluate the composition of implemented functions correctly. It should evaluate `f(g(2))` to `16.00000000000000` but instead returns the unevaluated expression `f(g(2))`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the evaluation of a single implemented function.\n   - Test the evaluation of a composition of two implemented functions.\n   - Test the evaluation of a composition of more than two implemented functions.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Evaluate with zero or negative numbers.\n   - Evaluate with non-integer numbers.\n   - Evaluate with nested compositions of functions.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. **Test Setup**:\n   - Import necessary modules and functions from `sympy`.\n   - Define implemented functions using `implemented_function`.\n\n2. **Test Input**:\n   - Create two implemented functions, `f` and `g`, where `f(x) = x^2` and `g(x) = 2*x`.\n   - Use a composition of these functions as input, e.g., `f(g(2))`.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering**:\n   - Call `evalf()` on the composition `f(g(2))`.\n   - The bug is triggered when `evalf()` does not evaluate the composition recursively.\n\n4. **Test Structure**:\n   - Define a test function.\n   - Set up the implemented functions `f` and `g`.\n   - Evaluate `f(g(2))` using `evalf()`.\n   - Capture the output.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Assert that the output is equal to the unevaluated expression `f(g(2))`.\n   - This assertion will pass if the bug is present, as the output will not be evaluated.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Test with `f(g(0))`, `f(g(-2))`, and `f(g(2.5))`.\n   - Test with nested compositions like `f(f(g(2)))`.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as the output will be the unevaluated expression.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now evaluates compositions correctly.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by checking for the incorrect behavior of the `evalf` method when dealing with compositions of implemented functions.

It fails to recursively evaluate the function when composed functions are involved.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The issue is described as: \"evalf does not call _imp_ recursively.\"\n   - Example provided: \n     ```python\n     >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n     >>> f = implemented_function('f', lambda x: x ** 2)\n     >>> g = implemented_function('g', lambda x: 2 * x)\n     >>> print(f(g(2)).evalf())\n     f(g(2))\n     ```\n   - The expected behavior is that `f(g(2)).evalf()` should evaluate to `16.00000000000000`, but it returns `f(g(2))`.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function `evalf` does not evaluate the composition of implemented functions correctly. It should evaluate `f(g(2))` to `16.00000000000000` but instead returns the unevaluated expression `f(g(2))`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the evaluation of a single implemented function.\n   - Test the evaluation of a composition of two implemented functions.\n   - Test the evaluation of a composition of more than two implemented functions.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Evaluate with zero or negative numbers.\n   - Evaluate with non-integer numbers.\n   - Evaluate with nested compositions of functions.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. **Test Setup**:\n   - Import necessary modules and functions from `sympy`.\n   - Define implemented functions using `implemented_function`.\n\n2. **Test Input**:\n   - Create two implemented functions, `f` and `g`, where `f(x) = x^2` and `g(x) = 2*x`.\n   - Use a composition of these functions as input, e.g., `f(g(2))`.\n\n3. **Bug Triggering**:\n   - Call `evalf()` on the composition `f(g(2))`.\n   - The bug is triggered when `evalf()` does not evaluate the composition recursively.\n\n4. **Test Structure**:\n   - Define a test function.\n   - Set up the implemented functions `f` and `g`.\n   - Evaluate `f(g(2))` using `evalf()`.\n   - Capture the output.\n\n5. **Assertions**:\n   - Assert that the output is equal to the unevaluated expression `f(g(2))`.\n   - This assertion will pass if the bug is present, as the output will not be evaluated.\n\n6. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Test with `f(g(0))`, `f(g(-2))`, and `f(g(2.5))`.\n   - Test with nested compositions like `f(f(g(2)))`.\n\n7. **Expected Outcome**:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, as the output will be the unevaluated expression.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that the function now evaluates compositions correctly.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by checking for the incorrect behavior of the `evalf` method when dealing with compositions of implemented functions. The test will pass if the bug is present, as it will confirm the incorrect behavior described in the issue ticket. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Function._eval_evalf\",\"path\":\"sympy/core/function.py\",\"line\":500}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_yx4vbcvWI7zJMwhLbshAIR68", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_yx4vbcvWI7zJMwhLbshAIR68", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core.expr import Expr\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import Float\nimport mpmath\n\nclass Function(Application, Expr):\n    ...\n\n    def _eval_evalf(self, prec):\n        fname = self.func.__name__\n        try:\n            if not hasattr(mpmath, fname):\n                from sympy.utilities.lambdify import MPMATH_TRANSLATIONS\n                fname = MPMATH_TRANSLATIONS[fname]\n            func = getattr(mpmath, fname)\n        except (AttributeError, KeyError):\n            try:\n                return Float(self._imp_(*self.args), prec)\n            except (AttributeError, TypeError, ValueError):\n                return\n        try:\n            args = [arg._to_mpmath(prec + 5) for arg in self.args]\n\n            def bad(m):\n                from mpmath import mpf, mpc\n                if isinstance(m, mpf):\n                    m = m._mpf_\n                    return m[1] != 1 and m[-1] == 1\n                elif isinstance(m, mpc):\n                    m, n = m._mpc_\n                    return m[1] != 1 and m[-1] == 1 and (n[1] != 1) and (n[-1] == 1)\n                else:\n                    return False\n            if any((bad(a) for a in args)):\n                raise ValueError\n        except ValueError:\n            return\n        with mpmath.workprec(prec):\n            v = func(*args)\n        return Expr._from_mpmath(v, prec)\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrlWC7kEYaZROOEPA7BeIuhYgmu8Q", "created": 1752153744, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.pytest import raises\nfrom sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\nfrom sympy import Symbol\n\ndef test_evalf_composition_bug():\n    # Define implemented functions\n    f = implemented_function('f', lambda x: x ** 2)\n    g = implemented_function('g', lambda x: 2 * x)\n    \n    # Create a symbol for evaluation\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Evaluate the composition f(g(2))\n    result = f(g(2)).evalf()\n    \n    # Assert that the result is the unevaluated expression\n    # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n    assert str(result) == 'f(g(2))'\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is that the `_eval_evalf` method in the `Function` class does not recursively evaluate the composition of implemented functions.

Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.pytest import raises\nfrom sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\nfrom sympy import Symbol\n\ndef test_evalf_composition_bug():\n    # Define implemented functions\n    f = implemented_function('f', lambda x: x ** 2)\n    g = implemented_function('g', lambda x: 2 * x)\n    \n    # Create a symbol for evaluation\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Evaluate the composition f(g(2))\n    result = f(g(2)).evalf()\n    \n    # Assert that the result is the unevaluated expression\n    # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n    assert str(result) == 'f(g(2))'\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrlWXARrhnWW26Qg4MM04SfX08Pss", "created": 1752153765, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\nfrom sympy import Symbol\n\ndef test_evalf_composition_bug():\n    # Define implemented functions\n    f = implemented_function('f', lambda x: x ** 2)\n    g = implemented_function('g', lambda x: 2 * x)\n    \n    # Create a symbol for evaluation\n    x = Symbol('x')\n    \n    # Evaluate the composition f(g(2))\n    result = f(g(2)).evalf()\n    \n    # Assert that the result is correctly evaluated\n    assert result == 16.0\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 128, "prompt_tokens": 715, "total_tokens": 843, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
