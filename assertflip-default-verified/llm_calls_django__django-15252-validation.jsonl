We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following: \\nclass Router(object):\\n\\tdef allow_migrate(self, db, model):\\n\\t\\tif db == 'default':\\n\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n\\t\\treturn False\\nCurrent Behaviour\\nWe run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)\\nWhen this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied). \\nThe first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish). \\nensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table. \\nI believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\n<TEST_CODE>\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import connections, router\nfrom django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder\n\nclass MigrationRecorderRouterTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Setup a custom router\n        class TestRouter:\n            def allow_migrate(self, db, app_label, model_name=None, **hints):\n                return db == 'default'\n\n        self.router = TestRouter()\n        router.routers.append(self.router)\n\n    def tearDown(self):\n        # Cleanup the router\n        router.routers.remove(self.router)\n\n    def test_migration_recorder_respects_router(self):\n        # Apply a migration using MigrationRecorder\n        recorder_default = MigrationRecorder(connections['default'])\n\n        # Simulate applying a migration\n        recorder_default.record_applied('test_app', '0001_initial')\n\n        # Check if the django_migrations table is created in 'default'\n        self.assertTrue(recorder_default.has_table())\n\n        # Attempt to access a non-existent connection to simulate the bug\n        recorder_other = MigrationRecorder(connections['other_db'])\n        recorder_other.record_applied('test_app', '0001_initial')\n        self.assertFalse(recorder_other.has_table())  # Correct behavior: table should not exist\n\n</TEST_CODE>\n\n<TEST_ERROR>\nCreating test database for alias 'default' ('file:memorydb_default?mode=memory&cache=shared')...\nTesting against Django installed in '/testbed/django'\nFound 1 test(s).\nSkipping setup of unused database(s): other.\nOperations to perform:\n  Synchronize unmigrated apps: auth, contenttypes, messages, sessions, staticfiles\n  Apply all migrations: admin, sites\nSynchronizing apps without migrations:\n  Creating tables...\n    Creating table django_content_type\n    Creating table auth_permission\n    Creating table auth_group\n    Creating table auth_user\n    Creating table django_session\n    Running deferred SQL...\nRunning migrations:\n  Applying admin.0001_initial...

The error indicates that the connection 'other_db' doesn't exist, which is unrelated to the issue of MigrationRecorder not respecting the router rules. The test should instead verify the behavior by checking the actual databases that are set up and ensuring that migrations are not applied to them if the router disallows it.
