The problem arises when considering replacing this with Python's `html.escape()`, which escapes single quotes differently (`&#x27;` instead of `&#39;`). The test should confirm that the current implementation escapes single quotes as `&#39;`, which is the expected behavior according to the current implementation.\n\nTo expose this bug, I will write a test that:\n1. Imports the `escape` function from `django.utils.html`.\n2. Tests a string containing a single quote to ensure it is escaped as `&#39;`.\n3. Asserts that the current behavior is correct (i.e., single quotes are escaped as `&#39;`).\n\nThe test will pass with the current implementation but will expose the bug if the implementation is changed to use `html.escape()` without modification.\n\nI will use Django's `SimpleTestCase` to write this test, as it is suitable for simple unit tests without database interaction.\n", "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 353, "prompt_tokens": 3135, "total_tokens": 3488, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

We can replace this duplication with wider community developed version.\\nhtml.escape() has been available since Python 3.2:\\n\\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/html.html#html.escape\\nThis function is also faster than Django's. As Python bug \\u200bhttps://bugs.python.org/issue18020 concludes, using .replace() can be faster than .translate(). This function gets called numerous times when rendering templates.
