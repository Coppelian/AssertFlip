The problem is that the hash value of a field changes when it is assigned to a model class, which violates the immutability requirement of hash values. This can cause issues when fields are used as keys in dictionaries, as shown in the example provided in the issue ticket.\n\nLet's break down the plan to create a test that reveals this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules from Django, specifically `models`.\n   - Ensure that the Django environment is properly configured for testing, if necessary.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create an instance of a Django model field, such as `models.CharField(max_length=200)`.\n   - Use this field as a key in a dictionary to capture its initial hash value.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Assign the field to a model class, which should trigger the change in the hash value.\n   - This is done by creating a simple model class and assigning the field to one of its attributes.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the field and store it in a dictionary.\n   - Define a model class and assign the field to it.\n   - Attempt to access the field in the dictionary using the original field instance as the key.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the field is still present in the dictionary after being assigned to the model class.\n   - This assertion will pass if the hash value remains unchanged, but will fail if the hash changes, thus exposing the bug.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields to ensure the issue is not specific to `CharField`.\n   - Test with fields that have different attributes set to see if any specific attribute affects the hash behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the field remains accessible in the dictionary after being assigned to a model class, indicating that the hash value has not changed.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the hash value will remain consistent, and the field will be accessible in the dictionary.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a test that will expose the bug by demonstrating that the hash value of a field changes when it is assigned to a model class, which should not happen. The test will pass by asserting the presence of the field in the dictionary, which will fail once the bug is fixed, as the hash will remain consistent. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"Field.__hash__\", \"path\": \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", \"line\": 544}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_M7jmwWOGcbKCjvf38D0raeP8", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"Field.contribute_to_class\", \"path\": \"django/db/models/fields/__init__.py\", \"line\": 775}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_aLsGZB4T5WLILOAuCDtajp4I", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_M7jmwWOGcbKCjvf38D0raeP8", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import total_ordering\nfrom django.db.models.query_utils import RegisterLookupMixin\n\n@total_ordering\nclass Field(RegisterLookupMixin):\n    ...\n\n    def __hash__(self):\n        return hash((self.creation_counter, self.model._meta.app_label if hasattr(self, 'model') else None, self.model._meta.model_name if hasattr(self, 'model') else None))\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_aLsGZB4T5WLILOAuCDtajp4I", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import partialmethod, total_ordering\nfrom django.db.models.query_utils import RegisterLookupMixin\n\n@total_ordering\nclass Field(RegisterLookupMixin):\n    ...\n\n    def contribute_to_class(self, cls, name, private_only=False):\n        \"\"\"\n        Register the field with the model class it belongs to.\n\n        If private_only is True, create a separate instance of this field\n        for every subclass of cls, even if cls is not an abstract model.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.set_attributes_from_name(name)\n        self.model = cls\n        cls._meta.add_field(self, private=private_only)\n        if self.column:\n            setattr(cls, self.attname, self.descriptor_class(self))\n        if self.choices is not None:\n            if 'get_%s_display' % self.name not in cls.__dict__:\n                setattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name, partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self))\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass FieldHashTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_field_hash_immutability(self):\n        # Step 1: Create a CharField and use it as a key in a dictionary\n        field = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n        field_dict = {field: 'initial'}\n\n        # Step 2: Assign the field to a model class\n        class Book(models.Model):\n            title = field\n\n        # Step 3: Attempt to access the field in the dictionary\n        # The field should not be found due to the hash change\n        self.assertNotIn(field, field_dict)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is that the `__hash__` method of a Django model field changes when the field is assigned to a model class.

The problem is that the hash value of a field changes when it is assigned to a model class, which violates the immutability requirement of hash values. This can cause issues when fields are used as keys in dictionaries, as shown in the example provided in the issue ticket.\n\nLet's break down the plan to create a test that reveals this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules from Django, specifically `models`.\n   - Ensure that the Django environment is properly configured for testing, if necessary.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create an instance of a Django model field, such as `models.CharField(max_length=200)`.\n   - Use this field as a key in a dictionary to capture its initial hash value.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Assign the field to a model class, which should trigger the change in the hash value.\n   - This is done by creating a simple model class and assigning the field to one of its attributes.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the field and store it in a dictionary.\n   - Define a model class and assign the field to it.\n   - Attempt to access the field in the dictionary using the original field instance as the key.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the field is still present in the dictionary after being assigned to the model class.\n   - This assertion will pass if the hash value remains unchanged, but will fail if the hash changes, thus exposing the bug.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields to ensure the issue is not specific to `CharField`.\n   - Test with fields that have different attributes set to see if any specific attribute affects the hash behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the field remains accessible in the dictionary after being assigned to a model class, indicating that the hash value has not changed.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed, as the hash value will remain consistent, and the field will be accessible in the dictionary.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a test that will expose the bug by demonstrating that the hash value of a field changes when it is assigned to a model class, which should not happen. The test will pass by asserting the presence of the field in the dictionary, which will fail once the bug is fixed, as the hash will remain consistent. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Ensure the test environment is properly configured\nsettings.configure(INSTALLED_APPS=['django.contrib.contenttypes'])\n\nclass FieldHashTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_field_hash_immutability(self):\n        # Step 1: Create a CharField and use it as a key in a dictionary\n        field = models.CharField(max_length=200)\n        field_dict = {field: 'initial'}\n\n        # Step 2: Assign the field to a model class\n        class Book(models.Model):\n            title = field\n\n            class Meta:\n                app_label = 'test_app'\n\n        # Step 3: Attempt to access the field in the dictionary\n        # The field should not be found due to the hash change\n        self.assertNotIn(field, field_dict)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

But I found a reason to do so whilst implementing #26472 and the behaviour had me stumped for a little.\\nIMO we can revert the __hash__ change from #31750. Objects with the same hash are still checked for equality, which was fixed in that ticket. But it's bad if an object's hash changes, since it breaks its use in dicts.\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable.
