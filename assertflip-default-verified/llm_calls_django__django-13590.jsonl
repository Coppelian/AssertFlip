Specifically, the error occurs when the function attempts to reconstruct a named tuple using an iterator, which leads to a `TypeError`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"This project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters.\"\n   - \"On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\"\n   - \"When it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes an iterator to its constructor.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The function `resolve_lookup_value` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is responsible for handling tuples and lists.\n   - Lines 1077-1083 show that the function attempts to reconstruct the tuple using `type(value)(...)`, which is problematic for named tuples.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When a named tuple is passed to `resolve_lookup_value`, it should be reconstructed correctly. However, due to the use of an iterator, the named tuple constructor is not satisfied, leading to a `TypeError`.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Pass a named tuple to a function that uses `resolve_lookup_value` and observe the error.\n   - Ensure the named tuple has exactly two elements to match the described scenario.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider named tuples with more or fewer than two elements.\n   - Test with regular tuples to ensure they are handled correctly.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules and define a named tuple with two elements.\n   - Set up a mock or real instance of the class that uses `resolve_lookup_value`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a named tuple with two elements, e.g., `NamedTuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])`.\n   - Instantiate the named tuple with specific values, e.g., `Point(1, 2)`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the function that uses `resolve_lookup_value` with the named tuple as an argument.\n   - Ensure the function attempts to resolve the named tuple, triggering the reconstruction logic.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the necessary context or objects.\n   - Pass the named tuple to the function.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors raised.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message indicating a missing positional argument.\n   - Ensure the test passes by confirming the presence of the error, which indicates the bug.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with named tuples of different lengths.\n   - Test with regular tuples to ensure they do not trigger the error.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised when a named tuple is used, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as the error should no longer occur.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by using a named tuple as input, ensuring the test passes by confirming the presence of the error. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"resolve_lookup_value\",\"path\":\"django/db/models/sql/query.py\",\"line\":1072}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_gyJE3LtkFDrOJxZl2wFpg2ts", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_gyJE3LtkFDrOJxZl2wFpg2ts", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on resolve_lookup_value."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom django.db.models.sql.query import Query\n\nclass ResolveLookupValueTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_named_tuple_causes_type_error(self):\n        # Define a named tuple with two elements\n        Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])\n        point_instance = Point(1, 2)\n\n        # Create a Query instance (mock or real, depending on the setup)\n        query_instance = Query()\n\n        # Attempt to resolve the named tuple using resolve_lookup_value\n        try:\n            query_instance.resolve_lookup_value(point_instance, can_reuse=None, allow_joins=True)\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # Assert that the TypeError is raised with the expected message\n            self.assertEqual(str(e), \"__new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'\")\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is related to the handling of named tuples in the `resolve_lookup_value` function.

Specifically, the error occurs when the function attempts to reconstruct a named tuple using an iterator, which leads to a `TypeError`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"This project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters.\"\n   - \"On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.\"\n   - \"When it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes an iterator to its constructor.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The function `resolve_lookup_value` in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is responsible for handling tuples and lists.\n   - Lines 1077-1083 show that the function attempts to reconstruct the tuple using `type(value)(...)`, which is problematic for named tuples.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - When a named tuple is passed to `resolve_lookup_value`, it should be reconstructed correctly. However, due to the use of an iterator, the named tuple constructor is not satisfied, leading to a `TypeError`.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Pass a named tuple to a function that uses `resolve_lookup_value` and observe the error.\n   - Ensure the named tuple has exactly two elements to match the described scenario.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider named tuples with more or fewer than two elements.\n   - Test with regular tuples to ensure they are handled correctly.\n\n### Test Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary modules and define a named tuple with two elements.\n   - Set up a mock or real instance of the class that uses `resolve_lookup_value`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a named tuple with two elements, e.g., `NamedTuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])`.\n   - Instantiate the named tuple with specific values, e.g., `Point(1, 2)`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the function that uses `resolve_lookup_value` with the named tuple as an argument.\n   - Ensure the function attempts to resolve the named tuple, triggering the reconstruction logic.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the necessary context or objects.\n   - Pass the named tuple to the function.\n   - Capture any exceptions or errors raised.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised with the message indicating a missing positional argument.\n   - Ensure the test passes by confirming the presence of the error, which indicates the bug.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with named tuples of different lengths.\n   - Test with regular tuples to ensure they do not trigger the error.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised when a named tuple is used, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as the error should no longer occur.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by using a named tuple as input, ensuring the test passes by confirming the presence of the error. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom collections import namedtuple\nfrom django.db.models.sql.query import Query\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass DummyModel(models.Model):\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test'\n\nclass ResolveLookupValueTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_named_tuple_causes_type_error(self):\n        # Define a named tuple with two elements\n        Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])\n        point_instance = Point(1, 2)\n\n        # Create a Query instance with a dummy model\n        query_instance = Query(DummyModel)\n\n        # Attempt to resolve the named tuple using resolve_lookup_value\n        try:\n            query_instance.resolve_lookup_value(point_instance, can_reuse=None, allow_joins=True)\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # Assert that the TypeError is raised with the expected message\n            self.assertEqual(str(e), \"__new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'\")\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
