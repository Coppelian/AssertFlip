Test Setup:\n   - Create a figure using `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`.\n   - Add subplots to the figure.\n   - Plot some data on the subplots and set labels.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a simple dataset for plotting (e.g., time vs. speed and acceleration).\n   - Ensure labels are set on the axes to trigger `align_labels()` functionality.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `align_labels()` on the figure to align the labels.\n   - Attempt to pickle the figure using `pickle.dumps()`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the figure and subplots.\n   - Plot data and set labels.\n   - Call `align_labels()`.\n   - Use a try-except block to attempt pickling and catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised when pickling after `align_labels()`.\n   - Optionally, assert that pickling succeeds without calling `align_labels()`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with figures having different numbers of subplots.\n   - Test with figures that have no labels to align.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised when `align_labels()` is called and pickling is attempted.

Test Setup:\n   - Create a figure using `matplotlib.pyplot.figure()`.\n   - Add subplots to the figure.\n   - Plot some data on the subplots and set labels.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a simple dataset for plotting (e.g., time vs. speed and acceleration).\n   - Ensure labels are set on the axes to trigger `align_labels()` functionality.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `align_labels()` on the figure to align the labels.\n   - Attempt to pickle the figure using `pickle.dumps()`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the figure and subplots.\n   - Plot data and set labels.\n   - Call `align_labels()`.\n   - Use a try-except block to attempt pickling and catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised when pickling after `align_labels()`.\n   - Optionally, assert that pickling succeeds without calling `align_labels()`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with figures having different numbers of subplots.\n   - Test with figures that have no labels to align.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised when `align_labels()` is called and pickling is attempted. This confirms the presence of the bug.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the `TypeError` is no longer raised.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines a structured approach to writing a test that will expose the reported bug while ensuring the test passes by confirming the presence of the bug. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"align_labels\", \"path\": \"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_lXNKbb1iRmj7cJ43CnOHUOw5", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"pickle\", \"path\": \"lib/matplotlib/figure.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_avElLuJIYdy7uVaFMJlvXFbK", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_lXNKbb1iRmj7cJ43CnOHUOw5", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on align_labels."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_avElLuJIYdy7uVaFMJlvXFbK", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on pickle."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrjsCaYy95oBZjsFBWviJTStN9kK7", "created": 1752147420, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pickle\n\ndef test_pickle_figure_after_align_labels():\n    # Create a figure and add subplots\n    fig = plt.figure()\n    ax1 = fig.add_subplot(211)\n    ax2 = fig.add_subplot(212)\n    \n    # Plot data and set labels\n    time = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]\n    speed = [40000, 4300, 4500, 4700, 4800]\n    acc = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]\n    ax1.plot(time, speed)\n    ax1.set_ylabel('speed')\n    ax2.plot(time, acc)\n    ax2.set_ylabel('acc')\n    \n    # Call align_labels to trigger the bug\n    fig.align_labels()\n    \n    # Attempt to pickle the figure and expect a TypeError\n    with pytest.raises(TypeError):\n        pickle.dumps(fig)\n    \n    # Cleanup: Close the figure\n    plt.close(fig)\n\n# The test will pass if the TypeError is raised, confirming the presence of the bug.\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe ISSUE TICKET indicates a bug related to pickling a figure after calling `align_labels()`, resulting in a `TypeError` due to a `weakref.ReferenceType` object.
