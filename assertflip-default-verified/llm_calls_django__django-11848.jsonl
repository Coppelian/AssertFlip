Test Setup:\n   - No special setup is required beyond importing the necessary functions from the module. Ensure the test environment has access to the current year for comparison.\n\n2.

The issue is that the function currently hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years, which does not comply with the RFC 7231 specification.\n\nLet's break down the plan:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - No special setup is required beyond importing the necessary functions from the module. Ensure the test environment has access to the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a set of date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year. For example, if the current year is 2023, a date with the year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered by parsing a date string with a two-digit year that the current logic incorrectly interprets as being in the 2000s when it should be in the 1900s based on the RFC 7231 rule.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - The test should:\n     1. Define a set of test cases with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n     2. Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n     3. Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on the RFC 7231 rule.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is correctly adjusted to the most recent past year with the same last two digits, rather than being placed in the future.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future to ensure the logic correctly handles the boundary condition.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year, matching the expected incorrect behavior.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a test that will expose the incorrect behavior of the `parse_http_date` function when handling two-digit years, as described in the issue ticket. The test will pass under the current buggy implementation and fail once the bug is fixed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"parse_http_date\",\"path\":\"django/utils/http.py\",\"line\":158}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_skmlAsIfJwbBXkgzTJS48ctC", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_skmlAsIfJwbBXkgzTJS48ctC", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\nimport datetime\n\ndef parse_http_date(date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1.\n\n    The three formats allowed by the RFC are accepted, even if only the first\n    one is still in widespread use.\n\n    Return an integer expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.\n    \"\"\"\n    for regex in (RFC1123_DATE, RFC850_DATE, ASCTIME_DATE):\n        m = regex.match(date)\n        if m is not None:\n            break\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not in a valid HTTP date format' % date)\n    try:\n        year = int(m.group('year'))\n        if year < 100:\n            if year < 70:\n                year += 2000\n            else:\n                year += 1900\n        month = MONTHS.index(m.group('mon').lower()) + 1\n        day = int(m.group('day'))\n        hour = int(m.group('hour'))\n        min = int(m.group('min'))\n        sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n        result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n        return calendar.timegm(result.utctimetuple())\n    except Exception as exc:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not a valid date' % date) from exc\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Current year for reference\n        current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074\n        date_string = \"Sun, 06 Nov 74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior due to the bug\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999, not 2099\n        date_string = \"Sun, 06 Nov 99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior due to the bug\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1999)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe `parse_http_date` function is responsible for parsing dates according to RFC 7231, but it incorrectly handles two-digit years by hardcoding the interpretation of years 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.

The issue is that the function currently hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years, which does not comply with the RFC 7231 specification.\n\nLet's break down the plan:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - No special setup is required beyond importing the necessary functions from the module. Ensure the test environment has access to the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a set of date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year. For example, if the current year is 2023, a date with the year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered by parsing a date string with a two-digit year that the current logic incorrectly interprets as being in the 2000s when it should be in the 1900s based on the RFC 7231 rule.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - The test should:\n     1. Define a set of test cases with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n     2. Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n     3. Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on the RFC 7231 rule.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is correctly adjusted to the most recent past year with the same last two digits, rather than being placed in the future.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future to ensure the logic correctly handles the boundary condition.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year, matching the expected incorrect behavior.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a test that will expose the incorrect behavior of the `parse_http_date` function when handling two-digit years, as described in the issue ticket. The test will pass under the current buggy implementation and fail once the bug is fixed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Current year for reference\n        current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior due to the bug\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999, not 2099\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior due to the bug\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1999)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The issue is that the function currently hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years, which does not comply with the RFC 7231 specification.\n\nLet's break down the plan:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - No special setup is required beyond importing the necessary functions from the module. Ensure the test environment has access to the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a set of date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year. For example, if the current year is 2023, a date with the year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered by parsing a date string with a two-digit year that the current logic incorrectly interprets as being in the 2000s when it should be in the 1900s based on the RFC 7231 rule.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - The test should:\n     1. Define a set of test cases with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n     2. Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n     3. Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on the RFC 7231 rule.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is correctly adjusted to the most recent past year with the same last two digits, rather than being placed in the future.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future to ensure the logic correctly handles the boundary condition.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year, matching the expected incorrect behavior.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a test that will expose the incorrect behavior of the `parse_http_date` function when handling two-digit years, as described in the issue ticket. The test will pass under the current buggy implementation and fail once the bug is fixed, serving as an effective oracle for the issue.\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Current year for reference\n        current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # Correct behavior should interpret '74' as 2074 if within 50 years of current year\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999, not 2099\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2099)  # Correct behavior should interpret '99' as 2099 if within 50 years of current year\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\ntest_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug (test_n9q2c6u5.ParseHttpDateTests) ...

The issue ticket describes a problem where the function incorrectly interprets two-digit years based on a hardcoded range (0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999) instead of using the current year to determine if the year should be in the past or future. The test attempts to check this by asserting that the year '74' should be interpreted as 2074 and '99' as 2099, assuming they are within 50 years of the current year. However, the test is incorrect because it misinterprets the RFC requirement. According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits. Therefore, '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074, and '99' should be interpreted as 1999, not 2099. The test fails because it incorrectly expects the opposite behavior, which is not aligned with the RFC specification. Thus, the test does not correctly reproduce the bug as described in the issue ticket.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrdswbcKS98aQ6BFqRVChvQ6VLEm8", "created": 1752124402, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to carefully analyze the problem and devise a plan that accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231. Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is related to the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - The current logic hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years: 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.\n   - According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The relevant code is in the `parse_http_date` function, specifically lines 177-182, where the year is adjusted based on its value.\n   - The current logic does not compare the year against the current year to determine if it should be in the past or future.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect expectation that years like '74' should be interpreted as 2074, not 1974.\n   - The test did not align with the RFC 7231 requirement.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error was due to the incorrect assertion that '74' should be 2074, which is not aligned with the RFC.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with a date string with the year '74' and expect it to be interpreted as 1974.\n   2. Test with a date string with the year '99' and expect it to be interpreted as 1999.\n   3. Test with a date string with the year '50' and expect it to be interpreted as 2050 (if within 50 years of the current year).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n   2. Compare the parsed year against the current year to determine if the logic is incorrect.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to use date strings with two-digit years and assert that they are interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The strategy is to create test cases with two-digit years and verify that they are interpreted according to RFC 7231.\n   - The test should pass with the current buggy logic and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import necessary functions and determine the current year.\n   - Input: Date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years.\n   - Assertions: Verify that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1.

The issue ticket describes a problem where the function incorrectly interprets two-digit years based on a hardcoded range (0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999) instead of using the current year to determine if the year should be in the past or future. The test attempts to check this by asserting that the year '74' should be interpreted as 2074 and '99' as 2099, assuming they are within 50 years of the current year. However, the test is incorrect because it misinterprets the RFC requirement. According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits. Therefore, '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074, and '99' should be interpreted as 1999, not 2099. The test fails because it incorrectly expects the opposite behavior, which is not aligned with the RFC specification. Thus, the test does not correctly reproduce the bug as described in the issue ticket.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous test was rejected for the reasons above.\nYou MUST now try a different approach to exposing the bug.\nDo NOT repeat the same structure or assertions \u2014 think critically and generate a new test.\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to carefully analyze the problem and devise a plan that accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231. Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is related to the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - The current logic hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years: 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.\n   - According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The relevant code is in the `parse_http_date` function, specifically lines 177-182, where the year is adjusted based on its value.\n   - The current logic does not compare the year against the current year to determine if it should be in the past or future.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect expectation that years like '74' should be interpreted as 2074, not 1974.\n   - The test did not align with the RFC 7231 requirement.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error was due to the incorrect assertion that '74' should be 2074, which is not aligned with the RFC.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with a date string with the year '74' and expect it to be interpreted as 1974.\n   2. Test with a date string with the year '99' and expect it to be interpreted as 1999.\n   3. Test with a date string with the year '50' and expect it to be interpreted as 2050 (if within 50 years of the current year).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n   2. Compare the parsed year against the current year to determine if the logic is incorrect.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to use date strings with two-digit years and assert that they are interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The strategy is to create test cases with two-digit years and verify that they are interpreted according to RFC 7231.\n   - The test should pass with the current buggy logic and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import necessary functions and determine the current year.\n   - Input: Date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years.\n   - Assertions: Verify that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - Determine the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years, such as '74', '99', and '50'.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define test cases with two-digit years.\n   - Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n   - Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on RFC 7231.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"parse_http_date\",\"path\":\"django/utils/http.py\",\"line\":158}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_0LqgpeaXsiCJ2sKDWcjjtJqL", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_0LqgpeaXsiCJ2sKDWcjjtJqL", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\nimport datetime\n\ndef parse_http_date(date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1.\n\n    The three formats allowed by the RFC are accepted, even if only the first\n    one is still in widespread use.\n\n    Return an integer expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.\n    \"\"\"\n    for regex in (RFC1123_DATE, RFC850_DATE, ASCTIME_DATE):\n        m = regex.match(date)\n        if m is not None:\n            break\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not in a valid HTTP date format' % date)\n    try:\n        year = int(m.group('year'))\n        if year < 100:\n            if year < 70:\n                year += 2000\n            else:\n                year += 1900\n        month = MONTHS.index(m.group('mon').lower()) + 1\n        day = int(m.group('day'))\n        hour = int(m.group('hour'))\n        min = int(m.group('min'))\n        sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n        result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n        return calendar.timegm(result.utctimetuple())\n    except Exception as exc:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not a valid date' % date) from exc\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brdt62hBPC1wyqHcODvBEc0NOv7eA", "created": 1752124412, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1974)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999, not 2099\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1999)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is with the `parse_http_date` function, which incorrectly interprets two-digit years based on a hardcoded range.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is related to the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - The current logic hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years: 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.\n   - According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The relevant code is in the `parse_http_date` function, specifically lines 177-182, where the year is adjusted based on its value.\n   - The current logic does not compare the year against the current year to determine if it should be in the past or future.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect expectation that years like '74' should be interpreted as 2074, not 1974.\n   - The test did not align with the RFC 7231 requirement.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error was due to the incorrect assertion that '74' should be 2074, which is not aligned with the RFC.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with a date string with the year '74' and expect it to be interpreted as 1974.\n   2. Test with a date string with the year '99' and expect it to be interpreted as 1999.\n   3. Test with a date string with the year '50' and expect it to be interpreted as 2050 (if within 50 years of the current year).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n   2. Compare the parsed year against the current year to determine if the logic is incorrect.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to use date strings with two-digit years and assert that they are interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The strategy is to create test cases with two-digit years and verify that they are interpreted according to RFC 7231.\n   - The test should pass with the current buggy logic and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import necessary functions and determine the current year.\n   - Input: Date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years.\n   - Assertions: Verify that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - Determine the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years, such as '74', '99', and '50'.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define test cases with two-digit years.\n   - Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n   - Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on RFC 7231.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n</plan>\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, not 2074\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # Correct behavior should interpret '74' as 2074\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999, not 2099\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2099)  # Correct behavior should interpret '99' as 2099\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\ntest_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug (test_jwmod8f5.ParseHttpDateTests) ...

The test code, however, asserts that the year '74' should be interpreted as 2074 and '99' as 2099, which contradicts the RFC's guidance that years more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits. Therefore, the test is incorrect because it does not align with the RFC's requirements. The failure of the test is due to this incorrect assertion, not because it reveals the bug described in the issue ticket.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrdtN5rKoQj56YR0KxEsSeh2qWkJI", "created": 1752124429, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to carefully analyze the problem and devise a plan that accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231.

The issue ticket describes a problem where the function is hardcoded to interpret years 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999, which is incorrect according to the RFC. The test code, however, asserts that the year '74' should be interpreted as 2074 and '99' as 2099, which contradicts the RFC's guidance that years more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits. Therefore, the test is incorrect because it does not align with the RFC's requirements. The failure of the test is due to this incorrect assertion, not because it reveals the bug described in the issue ticket.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous test was rejected for the reasons above.\nYou MUST now try a different approach to exposing the bug.\nDo NOT repeat the same structure or assertions \u2014 think critically and generate a new test.\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to carefully analyze the problem and devise a plan that accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231. Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is related to the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - The current logic hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years: 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.\n   - According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The relevant code is in the `parse_http_date` function, specifically lines 177-182, where the year is adjusted based on its value.\n   - The current logic does not compare the year against the current year to determine if it should be in the past or future.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect expectation that years like '74' should be interpreted as 2074, not 1974.\n   - The test did not align with the RFC 7231 requirement.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error was due to the incorrect assertion that '74' should be 2074, which is not aligned with the RFC.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with a date string with the year '74' and expect it to be interpreted as 1974.\n   2. Test with a date string with the year '99' and expect it to be interpreted as 1999.\n   3. Test with a date string with the year '50' and expect it to be interpreted as 2050 (if within 50 years of the current year).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n   2. Compare the parsed year against the current year to determine if the logic is incorrect.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to use date strings with two-digit years and assert that they are interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The strategy is to create test cases with two-digit years and verify that they are interpreted according to RFC 7231.\n   - The test should pass with the current buggy logic and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import necessary functions and determine the current year.\n   - Input: Date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years.\n   - Assertions: Verify that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - Determine the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years, such as '74', '99', and '50'.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define test cases with two-digit years.\n   - Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n   - Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on RFC 7231.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"parse_http_date\",\"path\":\"django/utils/http.py\",\"line\":158}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_j8KmzoMYNBxosBHZITwQDN9b", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_j8KmzoMYNBxosBHZITwQDN9b", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\nimport datetime\n\ndef parse_http_date(date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1.\n\n    The three formats allowed by the RFC are accepted, even if only the first\n    one is still in widespread use.\n\n    Return an integer expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.\n    \"\"\"\n    for regex in (RFC1123_DATE, RFC850_DATE, ASCTIME_DATE):\n        m = regex.match(date)\n        if m is not None:\n            break\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not in a valid HTTP date format' % date)\n    try:\n        year = int(m.group('year'))\n        if year < 100:\n            if year < 70:\n                year += 2000\n            else:\n                year += 1900\n        month = MONTHS.index(m.group('mon').lower()) + 1\n        day = int(m.group('day'))\n        hour = int(m.group('hour'))\n        min = int(m.group('min'))\n        sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n        result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n        return calendar.timegm(result.utctimetuple())\n    except Exception as exc:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not a valid date' % date) from exc\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrdtYmST1VLLC5CezB3Z4bFNQ3Umu", "created": 1752124440, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, but due to the bug, it is interpreted as 2074\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999, but due to the bug, it is interpreted as 2099\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2099)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is with the `parse_http_date` function, which incorrectly interprets two-digit years.

The issue ticket describes a problem where the function is hardcoded to interpret years 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999, which is incorrect according to the RFC. The test code, however, asserts that the year '74' should be interpreted as 2074 and '99' as 2099, which contradicts the RFC's guidance that years more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits. Therefore, the test is incorrect because it does not align with the RFC's requirements. The failure of the test is due to this incorrect assertion, not because it reveals the bug described in the issue ticket.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous test was rejected for the reasons above.\nYou MUST now try a different approach to exposing the bug.\nDo NOT repeat the same structure or assertions \u2014 think critically and generate a new test.\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to carefully analyze the problem and devise a plan that accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231. Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is related to the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - The current logic hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years: 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.\n   - According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The relevant code is in the `parse_http_date` function, specifically lines 177-182, where the year is adjusted based on its value.\n   - The current logic does not compare the year against the current year to determine if it should be in the past or future.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect expectation that years like '74' should be interpreted as 2074, not 1974.\n   - The test did not align with the RFC 7231 requirement.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error was due to the incorrect assertion that '74' should be 2074, which is not aligned with the RFC.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with a date string with the year '74' and expect it to be interpreted as 1974.\n   2. Test with a date string with the year '99' and expect it to be interpreted as 1999.\n   3. Test with a date string with the year '50' and expect it to be interpreted as 2050 (if within 50 years of the current year).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n   2. Compare the parsed year against the current year to determine if the logic is incorrect.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to use date strings with two-digit years and assert that they are interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The strategy is to create test cases with two-digit years and verify that they are interpreted according to RFC 7231.\n   - The test should pass with the current buggy logic and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import necessary functions and determine the current year.\n   - Input: Date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years.\n   - Assertions: Verify that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - Determine the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years, such as '74', '99', and '50'.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define test cases with two-digit years.\n   - Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n   - Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on RFC 7231.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"parse_http_date\",\"path\":\"django/utils/http.py\",\"line\":158}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_j8KmzoMYNBxosBHZITwQDN9b", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_j8KmzoMYNBxosBHZITwQDN9b", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\nimport datetime\n\ndef parse_http_date(date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1.\n\n    The three formats allowed by the RFC are accepted, even if only the first\n    one is still in widespread use.\n\n    Return an integer expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.\n    \"\"\"\n    for regex in (RFC1123_DATE, RFC850_DATE, ASCTIME_DATE):\n        m = regex.match(date)\n        if m is not None:\n            break\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not in a valid HTTP date format' % date)\n    try:\n        year = int(m.group('year'))\n        if year < 100:\n            if year < 70:\n                year += 2000\n            else:\n                year += 1900\n        month = MONTHS.index(m.group('mon').lower()) + 1\n        day = int(m.group('day'))\n        hour = int(m.group('hour'))\n        min = int(m.group('min'))\n        sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n        result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n        return calendar.timegm(result.utctimetuple())\n    except Exception as exc:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not a valid date' % date) from exc\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974, but due to the bug, it is interpreted as 2074\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999, but due to the bug, it is interpreted as 2099\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2099)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is with the `parse_http_date` function, which incorrectly interprets two-digit years.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is related to the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - The current logic hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years: 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.\n   - According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The relevant code is in the `parse_http_date` function, specifically lines 177-182, where the year is adjusted based on its value.\n   - The current logic does not compare the year against the current year to determine if it should be in the past or future.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect expectation that years like '74' should be interpreted as 2074, not 1974.\n   - The test did not align with the RFC 7231 requirement.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error was due to the incorrect assertion that '74' should be 2074, which is not aligned with the RFC.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with a date string with the year '74' and expect it to be interpreted as 1974.\n   2. Test with a date string with the year '99' and expect it to be interpreted as 1999.\n   3. Test with a date string with the year '50' and expect it to be interpreted as 2050 (if within 50 years of the current year).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n   2. Compare the parsed year against the current year to determine if the logic is incorrect.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to use date strings with two-digit years and assert that they are interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The strategy is to create test cases with two-digit years and verify that they are interpreted according to RFC 7231.\n   - The test should pass with the current buggy logic and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import necessary functions and determine the current year.\n   - Input: Date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years.\n   - Assertions: Verify that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - Determine the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years, such as '74', '99', and '50'.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define test cases with two-digit years.\n   - Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n   - Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on RFC 7231.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n</plan>\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 2074 according to the correct logic\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # Correct behavior according to RFC 7231\n\n        # Test case: Year '99' should be interpreted as 1999 according to the correct logic\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-99 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1999)  # Correct behavior according to RFC 7231\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\ntest_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug (test_vmkg4714.ParseHttpDateTests) ...

According to the issue ticket, the current implementation of `parse_http_date` interprets two-digit years from 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999, which is incorrect. The correct behavior, as per RFC 7231, is to interpret a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits. The test case checks if the year '74' is interpreted as 2074, which is incorrect according to RFC 7231. Instead, it should be interpreted as 1974, which is what the current implementation does. Therefore, the test case is incorrect in its expectation for the year '74'. The test case for the year '99' is correct, as it expects 1999, which aligns with the current implementation and RFC 7231. The test failure is due to the incorrect expectation for the year '74', not because of a bug in the `parse_http_date` function.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrdtxjnzE5OiMKDhoh0tJVLj4WVSZ", "created": 1752124465, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to carefully analyze the problem and devise a plan that accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231.

According to the issue ticket, the current implementation of `parse_http_date` interprets two-digit years from 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999, which is incorrect. The correct behavior, as per RFC 7231, is to interpret a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future as representing the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits. The test case checks if the year '74' is interpreted as 2074, which is incorrect according to RFC 7231. Instead, it should be interpreted as 1974, which is what the current implementation does. Therefore, the test case is incorrect in its expectation for the year '74'. The test case for the year '99' is correct, as it expects 1999, which aligns with the current implementation and RFC 7231. The test failure is due to the incorrect expectation for the year '74', not because of a bug in the `parse_http_date` function.\n</VALIDATION_FEEDBACK>\n\nIMPORTANT: Your previous test was rejected for the reasons above.\nYou MUST now try a different approach to exposing the bug.\nDo NOT repeat the same structure or assertions \u2014 think critically and generate a new test.\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.\n\nHere is a rough plan made by your supervisor:\n\n<PLAN> To address the reported issue and create a test that reveals the bug in the `parse_http_date` function, we need to carefully analyze the problem and devise a plan that accurately reflects the requirements of RFC 7231. Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The bug is related to the incorrect handling of two-digit years in the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - The current logic hardcodes the interpretation of two-digit years: 0-69 as 2000-2069 and 70-99 as 1970-1999.\n   - According to RFC 7231, a two-digit year that appears to be more than 50 years in the future should be interpreted as the most recent year in the past with the same last two digits.\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The relevant code is in the `parse_http_date` function, specifically lines 177-182, where the year is adjusted based on its value.\n   - The current logic does not compare the year against the current year to determine if it should be in the past or future.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect expectation that years like '74' should be interpreted as 2074, not 1974.\n   - The test did not align with the RFC 7231 requirement.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error was due to the incorrect assertion that '74' should be 2074, which is not aligned with the RFC.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test with a date string with the year '74' and expect it to be interpreted as 1974.\n   2. Test with a date string with the year '99' and expect it to be interpreted as 1999.\n   3. Test with a date string with the year '50' and expect it to be interpreted as 2050 (if within 50 years of the current year).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future.\n   2. Compare the parsed year against the current year to determine if the logic is incorrect.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - The most promising approach is to use date strings with two-digit years and assert that they are interpreted as the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - The strategy is to create test cases with two-digit years and verify that they are interpreted according to RFC 7231.\n   - The test should pass with the current buggy logic and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Import necessary functions and determine the current year.\n   - Input: Date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years.\n   - Assertions: Verify that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import the `parse_http_date` function.\n   - Determine the current year for comparison.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare date strings in RFC 850 format with two-digit years, such as '74', '99', and '50'.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Use date strings with two-digit years that are more than 50 years in the future relative to the current year.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define test cases with two-digit years.\n   - Call `parse_http_date` with these test cases.\n   - Capture the output and compare it against the expected year based on RFC 7231.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the parsed year is the most recent past year with the same last two digits.\n   - For example, assert that a date with the year '74' is parsed as 1974, not 2074.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider edge cases where the two-digit year is exactly 50 years in the future.\n   - Test with years '00' to '69' to ensure they are correctly interpreted as 2000-2069.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present because the current logic will incorrectly interpret the year.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the logic now correctly interprets the year according to RFC 7231.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"parse_http_date\",\"path\":\"django/utils/http.py\",\"line\":158}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_2SFLrkTJtbw58tQ2POMvOzVb", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_2SFLrkTJtbw58tQ2POMvOzVb", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nimport calendar\nimport datetime\n\ndef parse_http_date(date):\n    \"\"\"\n    Parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1.\n\n    The three formats allowed by the RFC are accepted, even if only the first\n    one is still in widespread use.\n\n    Return an integer expressed in seconds since the epoch, in UTC.\n    \"\"\"\n    for regex in (RFC1123_DATE, RFC850_DATE, ASCTIME_DATE):\n        m = regex.match(date)\n        if m is not None:\n            break\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not in a valid HTTP date format' % date)\n    try:\n        year = int(m.group('year'))\n        if year < 100:\n            if year < 70:\n                year += 2000\n            else:\n                year += 1900\n        month = MONTHS.index(m.group('mon').lower()) + 1\n        day = int(m.group('day'))\n        hour = int(m.group('hour'))\n        min = int(m.group('min'))\n        sec = int(m.group('sec'))\n        result = datetime.datetime(year, month, day, hour, min, sec)\n        return calendar.timegm(result.utctimetuple())\n    except Exception as exc:\n        raise ValueError('%r is not a valid date' % date) from exc\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brdu7ko2Qv9YRVBF8LYlB2CfiCvqV", "created": 1752124475, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974 according to the current buggy logic\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1974)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Test case: Year '50' should be interpreted as 2050 according to the current buggy logic\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-50 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2050)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is with the `parse_http_date` function, which incorrectly interprets two-digit years.

Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 1974 according to the current buggy logic\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1974)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n        # Test case: Year '50' should be interpreted as 2050 according to the current buggy logic\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-50 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the incorrect behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2050)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrduFwW8vgJ6dBlMCEXucvbE1gsPc", "created": 1752124483, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.utils.http import parse_http_date\nimport datetime\n\nclass ParseHttpDateTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_parse_http_date_two_digit_year_bug(self):\n        # Test case: Year '74' should be interpreted as 2074 according to the correct logic\n        # Using RFC850_DATE format: 'Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT'\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-74 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 2074)  # Correct behavior: should be interpreted as 2074\n\n        # Test case: Year '50' should be interpreted as 1950 according to the correct logic\n        date_string = \"Sunday, 06-Nov-50 08:49:37 GMT\"\n        parsed_timestamp = parse_http_date(date_string)\n        parsed_year = datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp(parsed_timestamp).year\n\n        # Assert the correct behavior\n        self.assertEqual(parsed_year, 1950)  # Correct behavior: should be interpreted as 1950\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 265, "prompt_tokens": 789, "total_tokens": 1054, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
