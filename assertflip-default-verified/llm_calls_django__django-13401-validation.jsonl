I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\n<TEST_CODE>\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\n\nclass AbstractModelA(models.Model):\n    class Meta:\n        abstract = True\n    myfield = models.IntegerField()\n\nclass ConcreteModelB(AbstractModelA):\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass ConcreteModelC(AbstractModelA):\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass FieldEqualityTest(TestCase):\n    def test_field_equality_bug(self):\n        # Retrieve the field objects from both models\n        field_b = ConcreteModelB._meta.get_field('myfield')\n        field_c = ConcreteModelC._meta.get_field('myfield')\n\n        # Add the field objects to a set\n        field_set = {field_b, field_c}\n\n        # Assert that the length of the set is 2, indicating the bug is fixed\n        self.assertEqual(len(field_set), 2)\n\n</TEST_CODE>\n\n<TEST_ERROR>\nCreating test database for alias 'default' ('file:memorydb_default?mode=memory&cache=shared')...\ntest_field_equality_bug (test_w97ge34c.FieldEqualityTest) ...

The test creates two concrete models, B and C, both inheriting from an abstract model A with a field 'myfield'. It then retrieves the 'myfield' from both models and adds them to a set. The expectation is that the set should contain two distinct field objects, indicating that they are not considered equal. However, the test fails because the set only contains one field object, confirming the reported issue that fields from different models are being considered equal.
