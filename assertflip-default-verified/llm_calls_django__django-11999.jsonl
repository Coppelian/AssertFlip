Let's break down the problem and plan the test accordingly.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django model similar to the example provided in the issue ticket. This model should have a `CharField` with choices and an overridden `get_FIELD_display` method.\n   - Ensure the Django environment is set up to use version 2.2 or later.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a model class `FooBar` with a `CharField` named `foo_bar` and choices `[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')]`.\n   - Override the `get_foo_bar_display` method to return a custom string, e.g., \"something\".\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Instantiate the `FooBar` model and set the `foo_bar` field to one of the choice values.\n   - Call the `get_foo_bar_display` method and observe the output.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the Django test environment.\n   - Define the `FooBar` model with the specified field and method override.\n   - Create an instance of `FooBar` and set the `foo_bar` field.\n   - Call the `get_foo_bar_display` method and capture the output.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the output of `get_foo_bar_display` is the custom string \"something\".\n   - This assertion will pass if the bug is present (i.e., the method is not overridden correctly in Django 2.2+).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different choice values to ensure the method override is consistently failing.\n   - Test with no choices to see if the behavior changes.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, meaning the method override does not work, and the output is not \"something\".\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the method override is functioning correctly and returning \"something\".\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test that will expose the bug by demonstrating that the overridden method does not return the expected custom string in Django 2.2+. The test will pass if the bug is present, as the assertion will confirm the incorrect behavior. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"_get_FIELD_display\",\"path\":\"django/db/models/base.py\",\"line\":941}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_b2ulvpUcgbU4YpRLl6h6tKP0", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_b2ulvpUcgbU4YpRLl6h6tKP0", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on _get_FIELD_display."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n\nclass FooBar(models.Model):\n    foo_bar = models.CharField(_(\"foo\"), choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')])\n\n    def get_foo_bar_display(self):\n        return \"something\"\n\nclass FooBarTest(TestCase):\n    def test_get_foo_bar_display_override(self):\n        # Create an instance of FooBar with foo_bar set to 1\n        obj = FooBar(foo_bar=1)\n        \n        # Call the overridden get_foo_bar_display method\n        result = obj.get_foo_bar_display()\n        \n        # Assert that the result is not \"something\"\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotEqual(result, \"something\")\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue ticket describes a problem with overriding the `get_FIELD_display` method in Django 2.2+. The plan suggests creating a test that demonstrates the bug by showing that the overridden method does not return the expected custom string.
