Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3.

Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"alter_field\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 123}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_fBWNI6kO4EfAgSpRGq3Ic8Wq", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"database_forwards\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py\", \"line\": 227}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_LtrJzZnVM4VE2UdWNtkpoaMG", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_fBWNI6kO4EfAgSpRGq3Ic8Wq", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on alter_field."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_LtrJzZnVM4VE2UdWNtkpoaMG", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on database_forwards."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrhcKnsIEznd8SJiyU8S9k1EXzSPc", "created": 1752138748, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('draft', 'Draft'), ('published', 'Published')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        # Define a migration that alters the field by adding a choice\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('draft', 'Draft'), ('published', 'Published'), ('archived', 'Archived')]),\n        )\n\n        # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            out = StringIO()\n            schema_editor.connection.cursor().execute = lambda sql, params=None: out.write(sql + \"\\n\")\n            migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.model_state)\n\n        # Get the executed SQL statements\n        executed_sql = out.getvalue()\n\n        # Assert that no unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        self.assertNotIn(\"CREATE TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"INSERT INTO\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"DROP TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"ALTER TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"alter_field\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 123}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_fBWNI6kO4EfAgSpRGq3Ic8Wq", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"database_forwards\", \"path\": \"django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py\", \"line\": 227}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_LtrJzZnVM4VE2UdWNtkpoaMG", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_fBWNI6kO4EfAgSpRGq3Ic8Wq", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on alter_field."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_LtrJzZnVM4VE2UdWNtkpoaMG", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on database_forwards."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('draft', 'Draft'), ('published', 'Published')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        # Define a migration that alters the field by adding a choice\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('draft', 'Draft'), ('published', 'Published'), ('archived', 'Archived')]),\n        )\n\n        # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            out = StringIO()\n            schema_editor.connection.cursor().execute = lambda sql, params=None: out.write(sql + \"\\n\")\n            migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.model_state)\n\n        # Get the executed SQL statements\n        executed_sql = out.getvalue()\n\n        # Assert that no unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        self.assertNotIn(\"CREATE TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"INSERT INTO\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"DROP TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertNotIn(\"ALTER TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            apps=self.apps,\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        # Define a migration that alters the field by adding a choice\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")\n            with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n                out = StringIO()\n                schema_editor.connection.connection.set_trace_callback(out.write)\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = out.getvalue()\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;\")\n\n        # Assert that no unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        self.assertIn(\"CREATE TABLE\", executed_sql)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"INSERT INTO\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"DROP TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"ALTER TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        # Define a migration that alters the field by adding a choice\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")\n            with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n                out = StringIO()\n                schema_editor.connection.connection.set_trace_callback(out.write)\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = out.getvalue()\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;\")\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # These assertions should pass if the bug is present\n        self.assertIn(\"CREATE TABLE\", executed_sql)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"INSERT INTO\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"DROP TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"ALTER TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        # Define a migration that alters the field by adding a choice\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")  # Disable foreign key checks\n            with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n                out = StringIO()\n                schema_editor.connection.connection.set_trace_callback(out.write)\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = out.getvalue()\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;\")  # Re-enable foreign key checks\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # These assertions should pass if the bug is present\n        self.assertIn(\"CREATE TABLE\", executed_sql)\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"INSERT INTO\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"DROP TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertIn(\"ALTER TABLE\", executed_sql)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        # Define a migration that alters the field by adding a choice\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")  # Disable foreign key checks\n            with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n                out = StringIO()\n                schema_editor.connection.connection.set_trace_callback(out.write)\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = out.getvalue()\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;\")  # Re-enable foreign key checks\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # These assertions should pass if the bug is present\n        self.assertTrue(any(op in executed_sql for op in [\"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", \"ALTER TABLE\"]))\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.schema_editor() as schema_editor:\n            # Disable foreign key checks to avoid errors during the test\n            schema_editor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")\n            # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n            with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                out = StringIO()\n                with connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True) as schema_editor:\n                    migration.database_forwards('testapp', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                    executed_sql = out.getvalue()\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # BUG: This assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert \"CREATE TABLE\" in executed_sql\n        assert \"INSERT INTO\" in executed_sql\n        assert \"DROP TABLE\" in executed_sql\n        assert \"ALTER TABLE\" not in executed_sql  # This should not be present, but it is due to the bug\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            # Disable foreign key checks to avoid errors during the test\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")\n            # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n            out = StringIO()\n            with connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('testapp', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = schema_editor.collected_sql\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # BUG: This assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert any(\"CREATE TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql)\n        assert any(\"INSERT INTO\" in sql for sql in executed_sql)\n        assert any(\"DROP TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql)\n        assert not any(\"ALTER TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql)  # This should not be present, but it is due to the bug\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            # Disable foreign key checks to avoid errors during the test\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")\n            # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n            out = StringIO()\n            with connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = schema_editor.collected_sql\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # BUG: This assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert any(\"CREATE TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected CREATE TABLE in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"INSERT INTO\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected INSERT INTO in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"DROP TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected DROP TABLE in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"ALTER TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected ALTER TABLE in SQL\"  # This should not be present, but it is due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            # Disable foreign key checks to avoid errors during the test\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")\n            # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n            out = StringIO()\n            with connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = schema_editor.collected_sql\n\n            # Re-enable foreign key checks\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;\")\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # BUG: This assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert any(\"CREATE TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected CREATE TABLE in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"INSERT INTO\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected INSERT INTO in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"DROP TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected DROP TABLE in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"ALTER TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected ALTER TABLE in SQL\"  # This should not be present, but it is due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Here's a detailed plan to write such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Set up a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Create a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='testmodel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            # Disable foreign key checks to avoid errors during the test\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF;\")\n            # Capture the SQL operations executed during the migration\n            out = StringIO()\n            with connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n                executed_sql = schema_editor.collected_sql\n\n            # Re-enable foreign key checks\n            cursor.execute(\"PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;\")\n\n        # Assert that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        # BUG: This assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert any(\"CREATE TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected CREATE TABLE in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"INSERT INTO\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected INSERT INTO in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"DROP TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected DROP TABLE in SQL\"\n        assert any(\"ALTER TABLE\" in sql for sql in executed_sql), \"Expected ALTER TABLE in SQL\"  # This should not be present, but it is due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Your goal is to plan out the creation of one or more test functions that that pass but still reproduce and expose the reported bug. The test/tests must pass if the bug is present and fail once the bug is fixed..\nYou will be provided with a ISSUE TICKET and a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference. \nYou will also be given the THOUGHT PROCESS of your junior who is trying to write the test which was clearly wrong and failed to reproduce the bug. The TEST ATTEMPT they wrote and the error it produced will also be provided.\nYour task is to analyze the described problem and previous attempt in detail and create a new PLAN for writing the test.\n                       \nFirst, carefully read the ISSUE TICKET and inspect the collected CODE SNIPPETS.\nReview the THOUGHT PROCESS of your junior and identify the mistakes made in the previous plan.\nAnalyze the problem reported critically and create a new PLAN from scratch with no reference to the previous one\nUse the following steps:\n\n<bug_analysis>\n1. Analyze the issue ticket:\n   - Identify the key components of the reported bug\n   - Note any specific conditions or scenarios mentioned\n   - Quote relevant parts of the issue ticket\n\n2. Review the code snippets:\n   - Identify the relevant parts of the code that might be causing the bug\n   - Look for any potential edge cases or boundary conditions\n   - Quote relevant parts of the code snippets\n\n3. Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:\n   - Identify the main flaws in their approach\n   - Note any correct insights or partial solutions\n\n4. Analyze the error received:\n   - Determine if the error is related to the test implementation or the actual bug\n\n5. List potential test cases:\n   1. [Test case 1]\n   2. [Test case 2]\n   3. [Test case 3]\n   ...\n\n6. Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:\n   1. [Trigger method 1]\n   2. [Trigger method 2]\n   3. [Trigger method 3]\n   ...\n\n7. Evaluate approaches:\n   - Pros and cons of each potential test case and trigger method\n   - Select the most promising approach\n\n8. Formulate a new approach:\n   - Devise a strategy to trigger the bug consistently\n   - Plan how to structure the test to pass normal cases but fail for the bug\n   - Consider edge cases and potential variations of the bug\n\n9. Outline test components:\n   - Determine necessary setup and teardown steps\n   - Plan input data or mock objects required\n   - Identify assertions needed to expose the bug\n</bug_analysis>\n\nBased on your analysis, create a detailed plan for writing the test. Your plan should focus on the logical structure and approach, without delving into specific implementation details of any testing framework. Ensure your plan is thorough and covers all aspects of triggering and exposing the bug.\n\nPresent your plan in the following format:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - [Describe necessary setup steps]\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - [Detail the input data or mock objects required]\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - [Explain how to consistently trigger the bug]\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - [Outline the logical flow of the test]\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - [List the key assertions needed to expose the bug]\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - [Identify any edge cases or variations to consider]\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - [Describe how the test will pass normal cases but fail for the bug]\n</plan>\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, or are missing information from the codebase you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it. You are encouraged to use it at this step to perfect the plan.                    \nRemember, do not write the actual test code. Focus on creating a comprehensive correct plan that will guide the junior developer in implementing an effective test.\n\nDO NOT provide implementation specific details pertaining to any testing framework. The project may use its own testing framework or a specific library so it could be misleading to provide such details.\n\nYou WILL be PENALIZED for copying the previous plan or any part of it. Use it to gain insights of what DOES NOT work, but do not reference it in your new plan.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Carefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET below, analyze the problem critically and create a detailed plan to write tests that reveal the bug.\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n(\"AlterField operation should be noop when adding/changing choices on SQLite.\\nDescription\\n\\t\\nwhile writing a test case for #33470 i found that for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed. on e.g. postgres the same migration generates no sql\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nHere are some snippets of possibly relevant code from the project:\n\n<CODE_SNIPPETS>\n('### django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\\n...\\n113|                         \"integrity.

Test Input:\n   - Define a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Monitor the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that no SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are executed.\n   - Specifically, check that operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\" are not present in the executed SQL.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider testing with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure the behavior is consistent across field types.\n   - Test with both adding new choices and modifying existing choices.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on setting up a controlled environment to observe the SQL operations triggered by a migration that should be a no-op on SQLite. The assertions are designed to pass if the bug is present, as they will detect the unnecessary SQL operations, and fail once the bug is fixed, ensuring the test serves as a reliable indicator of the issue.\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom io import StringIO\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n            # Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration process\n            with self.assertLogs('django.db.backends', level='DEBUG') as cm:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Check that no SQL operations were executed\n        executed_sql = \"\\n\".join(cm.output)\n        # BUG: The following assertions should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert \"CREATE TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"INSERT INTO\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"DROP TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"ALTER TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\nCreating test database for alias 'default' ('file:memorydb_default?mode=memory&cache=shared')...\nTesting against Django installed in '/testbed/django'\nFound 1 test(s).\nSkipping setup of unused database(s): other.\nOperations to perform:\n  Synchronize unmigrated apps: auth, contenttypes, messages, sessions, staticfiles\n  Apply all migrations: admin, sites\nSynchronizing apps without migrations:\n  Creating tables...\n    Creating table django_content_type\n    Creating table auth_permission\n    Creating table auth_group\n    Creating table auth_user\n    Creating table django_session\n    Running deferred SQL...\nRunning migrations:\n  Applying admin.0001_initial...

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"alter_field\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 123}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_IMGayEuzFcUAMJuavvEnUg2H", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"_remake_table\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 176}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_98iMBKKHddI0fXlmsQ9rQna2", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_IMGayEuzFcUAMJuavvEnUg2H", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on alter_field."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_98iMBKKHddI0fXlmsQ9rQna2", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on _remake_table."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrheiMT8xpsVsdoGGCIrUa3dLjs5g", "created": 1752138896, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor.execute') as mock_execute:\n            with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Check that unnecessary SQL operations were executed\n        executed_sql = \" \".join(call[0][0] for call in mock_execute.call_args_list)\n        # BUG: The following assertions should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert \"CREATE TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"INSERT INTO\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"DROP TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"ALTER TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe previous test attempt failed due to a `NotSupportedError` related to foreign key constraints when using the schema editor.

Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\nAdditionally, you will see the previous failed test attempt, the error, and validation feedback \u2014 you must try a NEW approach this time.\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"alter_field\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 123}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_IMGayEuzFcUAMJuavvEnUg2H", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"_remake_table\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 176}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_98iMBKKHddI0fXlmsQ9rQna2", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_IMGayEuzFcUAMJuavvEnUg2H", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on alter_field."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_98iMBKKHddI0fXlmsQ9rQna2", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on _remake_table."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor.execute') as mock_execute:\n            with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Check that unnecessary SQL operations were executed\n        executed_sql = \" \".join(call[0][0] for call in mock_execute.call_args_list)\n        # BUG: The following assertions should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert \"CREATE TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"INSERT INTO\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"DROP TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"ALTER TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe previous test attempt failed due to a `NotSupportedError` related to foreign key constraints when using the schema editor.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\nAdditionally, you will see the previous failed test attempt, the error, and validation feedback \u2014 you must try a NEW approach this time.\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Disable foreign key checks to avoid NotSupportedError\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;')\n\n        with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor.execute') as mock_execute:\n            with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Re-enable foreign key checks\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')\n\n        # Check that unnecessary SQL operations were executed\n        executed_sql = \" \".join(call[0][0] for call in mock_execute.call_args_list)\n        # BUG: The following assertions should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert \"CREATE TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"INSERT INTO\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"DROP TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        assert \"ALTER TABLE\" in executed_sql  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Disable foreign key checks to avoid NotSupportedError\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;')\n\n        with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n            with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Re-enable foreign key checks\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')\n\n        # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n        # BUG: The following assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        assert mock_remake_table.called  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Disable foreign key checks to avoid NotSupportedError\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;')\n\n        with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n            with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Re-enable foreign key checks\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')\n\n        # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n        # BUG: The following assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\nAdditionally, you will see the previous failed test attempt, the error, and validation feedback \u2014 you must try a NEW approach this time.\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Disable foreign key checks to avoid NotSupportedError\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;')\n\n        with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n            with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Re-enable foreign key checks\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')\n\n        # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n        # BUG: The following assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n        self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Disable foreign key checks to avoid NotSupportedError\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;')\n\n        try:\n            with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n                with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                    migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n            # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n            # BUG: The following assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n            self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        finally:\n            # Re-enable foreign key checks\n            with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Disable foreign key checks to avoid NotSupportedError\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;')\n\n        try:\n            with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n                with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                    migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n            # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n            # BUG: The following assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n            self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        finally:\n            # Re-enable foreign key checks\n            with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\nAdditionally, you will see the previous failed test attempt, the error, and validation feedback \u2014 you must try a NEW approach this time.\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.db import connection, migrations, models\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a model with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ],\n        )\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('status', models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = migrations.AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='status',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        # Disable foreign key checks to avoid NotSupportedError\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = OFF;')\n\n        try:\n            with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n                with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n                    migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n            # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n            # BUG: The following assertion should pass if the bug is present, indicating that unnecessary SQL operations are executed\n            self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        finally:\n            # Re-enable foreign key checks\n            with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n                cursor.execute('PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;')\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

This will demonstrate the bug while still passing the test.\n\nI will use the `django.test` framework as instructed, and I will use a mock to capture the SQL operations executed by the schema editor.

{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\nAdditionally, you will see the previous failed test attempt, the error, and validation feedback \u2014 you must try a NEW approach this time.\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import override_settings\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.migrations.state import ModelState\nfrom django.db.migrations.migration import Migration\nfrom django.db.migrations.operations import AlterField\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create initial model state with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ]\n        )\n        # Create new model state with an additional choice\n        self.new_model_state = migrations.state.ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    @override_settings(DATABASES={'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'}})\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='field',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n            with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue is that the `alter_field` operation on SQLite is generating unnecessary SQL operations when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.

Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import override_settings\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.migrations.state import ModelState\nfrom django.db.migrations.operations import AlterField\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create initial model state with a field that has choices\n        self.model_state = ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ]\n        )\n        # Create new model state with an additional choice\n        self.new_model_state = ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        )\n\n    @override_settings(DATABASES={'default': {'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3'}})\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='field',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n            with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.model_state, self.new_model_state)\n\n        # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt.\n</THOUGHT_PROCESS>\n\nHere is the test they wrote:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT>\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db.migrations.state import ProjectState\nfrom django.db.migrations.operations import AlterField\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create initial project state with a model that has a field with choices\n        self.initial_state = ProjectState()\n        self.initial_state.add_model(ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ]\n        ))\n\n        # Create new project state with an additional choice\n        self.new_state = ProjectState()\n        self.new_state.add_model(ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        ))\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='field',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n            with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.initial_state, self.new_state)\n\n        # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)\n\n</TEST_ATTEMPT>\n\nHere is the ERROR they received:\n<TEST_ATTEMPT_ERROR>\nCreating test database for alias 'default' ('file:memorydb_default?mode=memory&cache=shared')...\nTesting against Django installed in '/testbed/django'\nFound 1 test(s).\nSkipping setup of unused database(s): other.\nOperations to perform:\n  Synchronize unmigrated apps: auth, contenttypes, messages, sessions, staticfiles\n  Apply all migrations: admin, sites\nSynchronizing apps without migrations:\n  Creating tables...\n    Creating table django_content_type\n    Creating table auth_permission\n    Creating table auth_group\n    Creating table auth_user\n    Creating table django_session\n    Running deferred SQL...\nRunning migrations:\n  Applying admin.0001_initial...

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 1133, "prompt_tokens": 5556, "total_tokens": 6689, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 3328}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
{"instance_id": "django__django-15561", "messages": [{"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert Python test-driven developer tasked with creating tests that reveal reported bugs. Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\nAdditionally, you will see the previous failed test attempt, the error, and validation feedback \u2014 you must try a NEW approach this time.\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation. You can modify the plan as needed to create a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\nAuthority order (highest \u2192 lowest)\n   1. Facts returned from the get_info tool\n   2. These system instructions\n   3. Any PLAN you produce\n\nIf later calls to get_info contradict or simplify the PLAN, discard the PLAN and follow the new evidence instead.\nRefer to any test files provided for information about how tests are written in this project.\nReason about your approach and enclose your thoughts at the beginning of your response with <think> and </think> tags.\nOutput your final completed Python test script as a single block enclosed in backticks, without any additional explanation once you have started writing the test.\n\nYour output must be as follows:\n\n<think>\nReview the PLAN and reason how to go about writing a test that meets the requirements and constraints.\n</think>\n\n```python\nCOMPLETE TEST SCRIPT\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "\nCarefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET, potentially relevant CODE SNIPPETS and the PLAN made by your supervisor below.

Let's go through the analysis and create a new plan.\n\n### Bug Analysis\n\n1. **Analyze the issue ticket:**\n   - The key component of the reported bug is that the `AlterField` operation on SQLite generates unnecessary SQL operations (new table creation, insertion, dropping, renaming) when adding or changing choices, which should be a no-op.\n   - The issue is specific to SQLite, as the same migration on PostgreSQL generates no SQL.\n   - Relevant part: \"for sqlite, even a seemingly db-transparent change like adding choices still generates sql (new table + insert + drop + rename) even though this shouldn't be needed.\"\n\n2. **Review the code snippets:**\n   - The `alter_field` method in `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` is responsible for handling field alterations.\n   - The `_remake_table` method is called for operations that require remaking the table, which is likely where unnecessary SQL is generated.\n   - Relevant part: `self._remake_table(model, alter_field=(old_field, new_field))` in `_alter_field`.\n\n3. **Evaluate the junior developer's previous attempt:**\n   - The main flaw was the incorrect use of `assertLogs` to capture SQL operations, which led to a `NotSupportedError` due to foreign key constraints.\n   - The test setup and input were on the right track, but the method to capture and assert SQL operations was flawed.\n\n4. **Analyze the error received:**\n   - The error is related to the test implementation, specifically the use of `schema_editor` with `collect_sql=True` while foreign key constraints are enabled.\n\n5. **List potential test cases:**\n   1. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   2. Test altering a field by changing choices on a model with no foreign key constraints.\n   3. Test altering a field by adding choices on a model with foreign key constraints (to ensure constraints are handled).\n\n6. **Brainstorm ways to trigger the bug:**\n   1. Use a migration that alters a field's choices and observe the SQL operations.\n   2. Capture SQL operations using a mock or a custom logging handler.\n   3. Ensure the test environment is set up to allow capturing SQL without foreign key constraint issues.\n\n7. **Evaluate approaches:**\n   - Using a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations is promising, as it avoids the `NotSupportedError`.\n   - Testing with models that have no foreign key constraints simplifies the setup and focuses on the choices alteration.\n\n8. **Formulate a new approach:**\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture SQL operations during the migration.\n   - Ensure the test environment is set up to avoid foreign key constraint issues.\n   - Focus on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations.\n\n9. **Outline test components:**\n   - Setup: Create a model with a field that has choices, and prepare a migration to alter the choices.\n   - Input: Define the initial and altered model states with different choices.\n   - Bug Triggering: Apply the migration and capture SQL operations using a mock or logging handler.\n   - Structure: Initialize the database, apply the migration, and capture SQL.\n   - Assertions: Check for the presence of unnecessary SQL operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n   - Edge Cases: Test with different field types and ensure no foreign key constraints are present.\n   - Expected Outcome: The test should pass if unnecessary SQL operations are present and fail once the bug is fixed.\n\n### Plan\n\n```plaintext\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django test environment with a SQLite database backend.\n   - Define a simple Django model with a field that has a set of choices.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare a migration that alters the field by adding or changing the choices attribute.\n   - Ensure the migration does not alter any other field attributes that would require a database schema change.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Apply the migration using Django's migration framework.\n   - Use a mock or custom logging handler to capture the SQL operations executed during the migration process.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the test database with the initial model state.\n   - Apply the migration that alters the field choices.\n   - Capture the SQL statements executed during the migration using the mock or logging handler.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that SQL statements related to table creation, insertion, dropping, or renaming are present.\n   - Specifically, check for operations like \"CREATE TABLE\", \"INSERT INTO\", \"DROP TABLE\", and \"ALTER TABLE\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with different types of fields (e.g., IntegerField, CharField) to ensure consistent behavior.\n   - Ensure no foreign key constraints are present to avoid `NotSupportedError`.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that unnecessary SQL operations are executed.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that no SQL operations should have been executed for the choices change.\n```\n\nThis plan focuses on capturing and asserting the presence of unnecessary SQL operations using a mock or logging handler, avoiding the issues encountered in the previous attempt. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"alter_field\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 123}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_EYmqkoqAG0SDwhtDI55jPxiI", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"_alter_field\", \"path\": \"django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py\", \"line\": 420}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_z7FENGiuQgpETjEKFxsktRF4", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"AlterFieldTests.test_alter_field_add_choice_does_nothing\", \"path\": \"tests/schema/tests.py\", \"line\": 90}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_u7TDITkfleZ6ur5etAkTktPw", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_EYmqkoqAG0SDwhtDI55jPxiI", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on alter_field."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_z7FENGiuQgpETjEKFxsktRF4", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on _alter_field."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_u7TDITkfleZ6ur5etAkTktPw", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on AlterFieldTests.test_alter_field_add_choice_does_nothing."}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrhhEfIPMAyzVk4EQEJjT1eTE1dRl", "created": 1752139052, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db import connection, models\nfrom django.db.migrations.state import ProjectState, ModelState\nfrom django.db.migrations.operations import AlterField\nfrom unittest.mock import patch\n\nclass AlterFieldNoopTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Initial state with a model having a field with choices\n        self.initial_state = ProjectState()\n        self.initial_state.add_model(ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A')])),\n            ]\n        ))\n\n        # New state with an additional choice\n        self.new_state = ProjectState()\n        self.new_state.add_model(ModelState(\n            app_label='test_app',\n            name='TestModel',\n            fields=[\n                ('id', models.AutoField(primary_key=True)),\n                ('field', models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')])),\n            ],\n        ))\n\n    def test_alter_field_noop_on_sqlite(self):\n        migration = AlterField(\n            model_name='TestModel',\n            name='field',\n            field=models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('A', 'Option A'), ('B', 'Option B')]),\n        )\n\n        with connection.schema_editor(atomic=False) as schema_editor:\n            with patch('django.db.backends.sqlite3.schema.DatabaseSchemaEditor._remake_table') as mock_remake_table:\n                migration.database_forwards('test_app', schema_editor, self.initial_state, self.new_state)\n\n        # Check that _remake_table was called, indicating unnecessary SQL operations\n        # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n        self.assertTrue(mock_remake_table.called)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe previous test attempt failed due to an incorrect setup of the test environment, specifically the use of `ModelState` which lacks the `apps` attribute.
