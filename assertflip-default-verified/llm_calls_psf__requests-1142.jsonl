Test Setup:\n   - Initialize a session object from the requests library.\n   - Mock a server endpoint that returns a specific response when `Content-Length` is present.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a URL that is known to return an error when `Content-Length` is present (e.g., a mock server or a known endpoint like `http://amazon.com`).\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Send a GET request using the session object to the mock server or known endpoint.\n   - Ensure no body is provided in the request to simulate a typical GET request.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Create a session and prepare a GET request to the target URL.\n   - Capture the request headers before sending the request.\n   - Send the request and capture the response.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `Content-Length` header is not present in the request headers.\n   - Assert that the response status code is not 503, indicating the server did not reject the request due to `Content-Length`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with additional headers set by the user to ensure they do not affect the presence of `Content-Length`.\n   - Test with different server configurations to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `Content-Length` header is not present in the GET request headers and the server does not return a 503 error.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed if the `Content-Length` header is correctly omitted, as the assertion will expect it to be present to expose the bug.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug where `Content-Length` is incorrectly added to GET requests.

Test Setup:\n   - Initialize a session object from the requests library.\n   - Mock a server endpoint that returns a specific response when `Content-Length` is present.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a URL that is known to return an error when `Content-Length` is present (e.g., a mock server or a known endpoint like `http://amazon.com`).\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Send a GET request using the session object to the mock server or known endpoint.\n   - Ensure no body is provided in the request to simulate a typical GET request.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Create a session and prepare a GET request to the target URL.\n   - Capture the request headers before sending the request.\n   - Send the request and capture the response.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `Content-Length` header is not present in the request headers.\n   - Assert that the response status code is not 503, indicating the server did not reject the request due to `Content-Length`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with additional headers set by the user to ensure they do not affect the presence of `Content-Length`.\n   - Test with different server configurations to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `Content-Length` header is not present in the GET request headers and the server does not return a 503 error.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed if the `Content-Length` header is correctly omitted, as the assertion will expect it to be present to expose the bug.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug where `Content-Length` is incorrectly added to GET requests. The test will pass by confirming the presence of the header, which is the incorrect behavior, and will fail once the bug is fixed, as the header will no longer be present. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Request.prepare\",\"path\":\"requests/sessions.py\",\"line\":265}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_hkGOqaz5lfW8pS8vX96g49rs", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_hkGOqaz5lfW8pS8vX96g49rs", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Error executing function: cannot import name 'MutableMapping' from 'collections' (/opt/miniconda3/lib/python3.11/collections/__init__.py)"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-Brk0zgmr4OG5Ynzoiejso6J0o2xNH", "created": 1752147965, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom requests import Session\nfrom requests.models import Request\n\ndef test_get_request_includes_content_length_header(monkeypatch):\n    # Mock the send method to capture the prepared request\n    def mock_send(self, request, **kwargs):\n        # Assert that the 'Content-Length' header is present, which is the bug\n        assert 'Content-Length' in request.headers\n        # Return a mock response object\n        class MockResponse:\n            status_code = 200\n            headers = request.headers\n        return MockResponse()\n\n    # Use monkeypatch to replace the send method with the mock_send\n    monkeypatch.setattr(Session, 'send', mock_send)\n\n    # Create a session and prepare a GET request\n    session = Session()\n    request = Request('GET', 'http://example.com')\n    prepared_request = session.prepare_request(request)\n\n    # Send the request, which will use the mock_send method\n    response = session.send(prepared_request)\n\n    # Assert that the response status code is 200, indicating the mock worked\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n\n    # BUG: Assert that 'Content-Length' is present in the headers, which is incorrect behavior\n    assert 'Content-Length' in response.headers\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue ticket indicates that the `Content-Length` header is being added to GET requests, which is not standard behavior.

Test Setup:\n   - Initialize a session object from the requests library.\n   - Mock a server endpoint that returns a specific response when `Content-Length` is present.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a URL that is known to return an error when `Content-Length` is present (e.g., a mock server or a known endpoint like `http://amazon.com`).\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Send a GET request using the session object to the mock server or known endpoint.\n   - Ensure no body is provided in the request to simulate a typical GET request.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Create a session and prepare a GET request to the target URL.\n   - Capture the request headers before sending the request.\n   - Send the request and capture the response.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `Content-Length` header is not present in the request headers.\n   - Assert that the response status code is not 503, indicating the server did not reject the request due to `Content-Length`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with additional headers set by the user to ensure they do not affect the presence of `Content-Length`.\n   - Test with different server configurations to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `Content-Length` header is not present in the GET request headers and the server does not return a 503 error.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed if the `Content-Length` header is correctly omitted, as the assertion will expect it to be present to expose the bug.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug where `Content-Length` is incorrectly added to GET requests. The test will pass by confirming the presence of the header, which is the incorrect behavior, and will fail once the bug is fixed, as the header will no longer be present. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"Request.prepare\",\"path\":\"requests/sessions.py\",\"line\":265}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_hkGOqaz5lfW8pS8vX96g49rs", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_hkGOqaz5lfW8pS8vX96g49rs", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Error executing function: cannot import name 'MutableMapping' from 'collections' (/opt/miniconda3/lib/python3.11/collections/__init__.py)"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nimport pytest\nfrom requests import Session\nfrom requests.models import Request\n\ndef test_get_request_includes_content_length_header(monkeypatch):\n    # Mock the send method to capture the prepared request\n    def mock_send(self, request, **kwargs):\n        # Assert that the 'Content-Length' header is present, which is the bug\n        assert 'Content-Length' in request.headers\n        # Return a mock response object\n        class MockResponse:\n            status_code = 200\n            headers = request.headers\n        return MockResponse()\n\n    # Use monkeypatch to replace the send method with the mock_send\n    monkeypatch.setattr(Session, 'send', mock_send)\n\n    # Create a session and prepare a GET request\n    session = Session()\n    request = Request('GET', 'http://example.com')\n    prepared_request = session.prepare_request(request)\n\n    # Send the request, which will use the mock_send method\n    response = session.send(prepared_request)\n\n    # Assert that the response status code is 200, indicating the mock worked\n    assert response.status_code == 200\n\n    # BUG: Assert that 'Content-Length' is present in the headers, which is incorrect behavior\n    assert 'Content-Length' in response.headers\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe issue ticket indicates that the `Content-Length` header is being added to GET requests, which is not standard behavior.

Test Setup:\n   - Initialize a session object from the requests library.\n   - Mock a server endpoint that returns a specific response when `Content-Length` is present.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use a URL that is known to return an error when `Content-Length` is present (e.g., a mock server or a known endpoint like `http://amazon.com`).\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Send a GET request using the session object to the mock server or known endpoint.\n   - Ensure no body is provided in the request to simulate a typical GET request.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Create a session and prepare a GET request to the target URL.\n   - Capture the request headers before sending the request.\n   - Send the request and capture the response.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `Content-Length` header is not present in the request headers.\n   - Assert that the response status code is not 503, indicating the server did not reject the request due to `Content-Length`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with additional headers set by the user to ensure they do not affect the presence of `Content-Length`.\n   - Test with different server configurations to ensure consistent behavior.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `Content-Length` header is not present in the GET request headers and the server does not return a 503 error.\n   - The test will fail once the bug is fixed if the `Content-Length` header is correctly omitted, as the assertion will expect it to be present to expose the bug.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure a test to expose the bug where `Content-Length` is incorrectly added to GET requests. The test will pass by confirming the presence of the header, which is the incorrect behavior, and will fail once the bug is fixed, as the header will no longer be present. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nimport pytest\nfrom requests import Session\nfrom requests.models import Request\n\ndef test_get_request_includes_content_length_header(monkeypatch):\n    # Mock the send method to capture the prepared request\n    def mock_send(self, request, **kwargs):\n        # Assert that the 'Content-Length' header is present, which is the bug\n        assert 'Content-Length' in request.headers\n        # Return a mock response object\n        class MockResponse:\n            status_code = 503  # Simulate the server returning a 503 error due to 'Content-Length'\n            headers = request.headers\n        return MockResponse()\n\n    # Use monkeypatch to replace the send method with the mock_send\n    monkeypatch.setattr(Session, 'send', mock_send)\n\n    # Create a session and send a GET request\n    session = Session()\n    response = session.get('http://example.com')\n\n    # Assert that the response status code is 503, indicating the server rejected the request due to 'Content-Length'\n    assert response.status_code == 503\n\n    # BUG: Assert that 'Content-Length' is present in the headers, which is incorrect behavior\n    assert 'Content-Length' in response.headers\n```\n", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
