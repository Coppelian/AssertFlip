According to the issue ticket, the expected behavior is that `len` should return 1 for a rank-0 array, aligning with the behavior observed in numpy. The test code correctly creates a rank-0 array using `Array(3)` and asserts that `len(a)` should be 1. However, the test fails with an `AssertionError`, indicating that `len(a)` does not return 1, which is consistent with the reported issue that `len` returns 0 for rank-0 arrays in sympy. Therefore, the test correctly reproduces the bug described in the issue ticket.", "revealing": true}}
