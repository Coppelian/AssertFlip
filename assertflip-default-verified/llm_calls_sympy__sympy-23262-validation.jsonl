I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n```python\\r\\nimport inspect\\r\\nfrom sympy import lambdify\\r\\n\\r\\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))\\r\\n```\\r\\nSymPy 1.9 and under outputs:\\r\\n```\\r\\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\\\n    return (1,)\\\\n'\\r\\n```\\r\\n\\r\\nBut SymPy 1.10 gives\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\\\n    return (1)\\\\n'\\r\\n```\\r\\nNote the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. \\r\\n\\r\\nFor tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:\\r\\n```python\\r\\ninspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))\\r\\n```\\r\\nIn SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:\\r\\n\\r\\n```\\r\\n'def _lambdifygenerated():\\\\n    return (1, 2)\\\\n'\\r\\n```\\r\\nThis result is expected.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side?

The issue ticket describes a problem where SymPy 1.10 generates code that returns an integer instead of a tuple due to the missing comma. The test code attempts to reproduce this issue by using `lambdify` to create a function that returns a single-element tuple and then checking if the generated source code contains the correct tuple syntax with a comma. The test fails because the assertion that the source code includes \"return (1,)\" is not met, indicating that the bug is indeed reproduced by the test. Therefore, the test is valid and correctly reveals the bug described in the issue ticket.", "revealing": true}}
