Just when using the lookup in a filter, the optimization is used (even when explicitly using an annotation):\\n# annotation works\\n>>> qs = DTModel.objects.annotate(extracted=ExtractIsoYear(\\'start_date\\')).only(\\'id\\')\\n>>> print(qs.query)\\nSELECT \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"id\", EXTRACT(\\'isoyear\\' FROM \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"start_date\") AS \"extracted\" FROM \"db_functions_dtmodel\"\\n# explicit annotation used in filter does not use \"extracted\" and adds BETWEEN\\n>>> print(qs.filter(extracted=2020).query)\\nSELECT \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"id\", EXTRACT(\\'isoyear\\' FROM \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"start_date\") AS \"extracted\" FROM \"db_functions_dtmodel\" WHERE \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"start_date\" BETWEEN 2020-01-01 AND 2020-12-31\\n# implicit lookup uses BETWEEN\\n>>> print(DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only(\\'id\\').query)\\nSELECT \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"id\" FROM \"db_functions_dtmodel\" WHERE \"db_functions_dtmodel\".\"start_date\" BETWEEN 2020-01-01 AND 2020-12-31\\nThis results in the wrong data being returned by filters using iso_year.\\nThis PR fixes the behaviour, reverts the invalid changes to the tests and extends one test to catch this problem: \\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/14157\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\n<TEST_CODE>\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.db import connection\nfrom django.db.models.functions import ExtractIsoYear\n\n# Define a test model\nclass DTModel(models.Model):\n    start_date = models.DateField()\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass IsoYearLookupTest(TestCase):\n    databases = {'default'}\n\n    @classmethod\n    def setUpTestData(cls):\n        # Create the table manually since migrations are not applied\n        with connection.cursor() as cursor:\n            cursor.execute('CREATE TABLE test_app_dtmodel (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, start_date DATE)')\n\n        # Setup a test database with known dates\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-01-01')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2020-12-31')\n        DTModel.objects.create(start_date='2021-01-01')\n\n    def test_iso_year_lookup_uses_between(self):\n        # Perform a query using __iso_year\n        qs = DTModel.objects.filter(start_date__iso_year=2020).only('id')\n        query = str(qs.query)\n\n        # Check if the query uses EXTRACT instead of BETWEEN\n        self.assertIn('EXTRACT', query)\n\n</TEST_CODE>\n\n<TEST_ERROR>\nTesting against Django installed in '/testbed/django'\nSkipping setup of unused database(s): other.\nOperations to perform:\n  Synchronize unmigrated apps: auth, contenttypes, messages, sessions, staticfiles\n  Apply all migrations: admin, sites\nSynchronizing apps without migrations:\n  Creating tables...\n    Creating table django_content_type\n    Creating table auth_permission\n    Creating table auth_group\n    Creating table auth_user\n    Creating table django_session\n    Running deferred SQL...\nRunning migrations:\n  Applying admin.0001_initial...

According to the issue ticket, the problem is that the optimization incorrectly uses BETWEEN, which leads to incorrect filtering results. The test sets up a scenario where it filters dates by the ISO year 2020 and checks if the generated SQL query contains the EXTRACT function. However, the test fails because the query uses BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT, which is exactly the issue described in the ticket. Therefore, the test correctly reproduces the bug as it demonstrates that the optimization is incorrectly applied, leading to the use of BETWEEN instead of EXTRACT.", "revealing": true}}
