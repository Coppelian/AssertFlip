Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('cla(), clf() should unset the `.axes` and `.figure` attributes of deparented artists\\nmpl2.0b3: Removing an artist from its axes unsets its `.axes` attribute, but clearing the axes does not do so.\\n\\n```\\nIn [11]: f, a = plt.subplots(); l, = a.plot([1, 2]); l.remove(); print(l.axes)\\nNone\\n\\nIn [12]: f, a = plt.subplots(); l, = a.plot([1, 2]); a.cla(); print(l.axes)\\nAxes(0.125,0.11;0.775x0.77)\\n```\\n\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable. Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_cla_does_not_unset_axes_attribute():\n    # Create a figure and axes\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    \n    # Plot a line to create an artist\n    line, = ax.plot([1, 2])\n    \n    # Clear the axes using cla()\n    ax.cla()\n    \n    # Assert that the .axes attribute of the artist is not None\n    # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n    assert line.axes is not None\n\n    # Cleanup\n    plt.close(fig)\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrjjkO9jevzulcw8z20t1WGz9WQK6", "created": 1752146896, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pytest\n\ndef test_cla_unsets_axes_attribute():\n    # Create a figure and axes\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    \n    # Plot a line to create an artist\n    line, = ax.plot([1, 2])\n    \n    # Clear the axes using cla()\n    ax.cla()\n    \n    # Assert that the .axes attribute of the artist is None\n    assert line.axes is None\n\n    # Cleanup\n    plt.close(fig)\n\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 108, "prompt_tokens": 623, "total_tokens": 731, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
