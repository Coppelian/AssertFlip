The code attempts to return True to indicate success or failure acquiring a lock, but instead it always returns False. The reason is that cpython fcntl module returns None if successful, and raises an OSError to indicate failure (see \\u200bhttps://docs.python.org/3/library/fcntl.html#fcntl.flock).\\nAnyone interested in using the non-blocking (i.e. locks.LOCKS_NB) requires a valid return value to know if they have successfully acquired the lock.\\nI believe the correct implementation should be the following:\\ndiff --git a/django/core/files/locks.py b/django/core/files/locks.py\\nindex c46b00b905..4938347ea7 100644\\n--- a/django/core/files/locks.py\\n+++ b/django/core/files/locks.py\\n@@ -107,9 +107,15 @@ else:\\n\\t\\t\\t return True\\n\\t else:\\n\\t\\t def lock(f, flags):\\n-\\t\\t\\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\\n-\\t\\t\\treturn ret == 0\\n+\\t\\t\\ttry:\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), flags)\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n+\\t\\t\\texcept OSError:\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n\\t\\t def unlock(f):\\n-\\t\\t\\tret = fcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\\n-\\t\\t\\treturn ret == 0\\n+\\t\\t\\ttry:\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\tfcntl.flock(_fd(f), fcntl.LOCK_UN)\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\treturn True\\n+\\t\\t\\texcept OSError:\\n+\\t\\t\\t\\treturn False\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable.
