Test Setup:\n   - Configure a minimal Django environment with necessary settings.\n   - Define a simple form class `MyForm` with at least one field.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create a `FormSet` using `formset_factory` with `MyForm`, `can_delete=True`, and `can_delete_extra=False`.\n   - Initialize the `FormSet` with `initial=None`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `empty_form` property on the `FormSet` to invoke the `add_fields` method with `index=None`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Set up the Django environment and form class.\n   - Create the `FormSet` with specified attributes.\n   - Access the `empty_form` property to trigger the bug.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Verify that accessing `empty_form` does not raise an exception.\n   - Check that the `DELETION_FIELD_NAME` is not added to the form fields when `index` is `None`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider variations where `can_delete_extra` is `True` to ensure the bug is specific to the described conditions.\n\n7.

Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('Formsets\\' add_fields() method fails in some circumstances if the argument index is None.\\nDescription\\n\\t\\nFormsets\\' add_fields() method fails in some circumstances if the argument index is None.\\nWhen a FormSet has the attributes self.can_delete == True and self.can_delete_extra == False, calling the add_fields() method on that FormSet fails if the argument index is None. This occurs for example when calling FormSet.empty_form(). The result is that the method raises the exception TypeError: \\'<\\' not supported between instances of \\'NoneType\\' and \\'int\\'. \\nCode example:\\nMyFormSet = forms.formset_factory(\\n\\tform=MyForm,\\n\\tcan_delete=True,\\n\\tcan_delete_extra=False,\\n)\\nmy_formset = MyFormSet(\\n\\tinitial=None,\\n)\\nprint(my_formset.empty_form)\\nThe reason this happens is that in in line 493 of [django.forms.formsets](\\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/blob/main/django/forms/formsets.py) index is compared to initial_form_count:\\nif self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or index < initial_form_count):\\nChecking for index not None should fix the issue:\\nif self.can_delete and (self.can_delete_extra or (index is not None and index < initial_form_count)):\\nHow to Reproduce\\nA self-contained example to reproduce this bug is as follows:\\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\\nimport os\\nimport django\\nfrom django import forms\\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\\n\\tmy_field = forms.CharField()\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n\\tsettings_file = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(__file__))[0]\\n\\tdjango.conf.settings.configure(\\n\\t\\tDEBUG=True,\\n\\t\\tMIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[],\\n\\t\\tROOT_URLCONF=settings_file,\\n\\t)\\n\\tdjango.setup()\\n\\tMyFormSet = forms.formset_factory(\\n\\t\\tform=MyForm,\\n\\t\\tcan_delete=True,\\n\\t\\tcan_delete_extra=False,\\n\\t)\\n\\tmy_formset = MyFormSet(\\n\\t\\tinitial=None,\\n\\t)\\n\\tprint(my_formset.empty_form)\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable. Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.forms import formset_factory\n\n# Ensure settings are configured only once\nif not settings.configured:\n    settings.configure(\n        DEBUG=True,\n        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[],\n        ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,\n    )\n\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n    my_field = forms.CharField()\n\nclass FormsetAddFieldsTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_add_fields_with_none_index(self):\n        # Create a FormSet with can_delete=True and can_delete_extra=False\n        MyFormSet = formset_factory(\n            form=MyForm,\n            can_delete=True,\n            can_delete_extra=False,\n        )\n        my_formset = MyFormSet(initial=None)\n\n        try:\n            # Access the empty_form property to trigger the bug\n            _ = my_formset.empty_form\n            # If no exception is raised, the test should fail\n            self.fail(\"TypeError not raised\")\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # BUG: This should raise a TypeError due to the comparison between NoneType and int\n            self.assertIn(\"not supported between instances of 'NoneType' and 'int'\", str(e))\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BriyGFHITmrUF0WytrLJS2otGTgKF", "created": 1752143952, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_5d58a6052a", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.conf import settings\nfrom django.forms import formset_factory\n\n# Ensure settings are configured only once\nif not settings.configured:\n    settings.configure(\n        DEBUG=True,\n        MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES=[],\n        ROOT_URLCONF=__name__,\n    )\n\nclass MyForm(forms.Form):\n    my_field = forms.CharField()\n\nclass FormsetAddFieldsTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_add_fields_with_none_index(self):\n        # Create a FormSet with can_delete=True and can_delete_extra=False\n        MyFormSet = formset_factory(\n            form=MyForm,\n            can_delete=True,\n            can_delete_extra=False,\n        )\n        my_formset = MyFormSet(initial=None)\n\n        try:\n            # Access the empty_form property to trigger the bug\n            _ = my_formset.empty_form\n        except TypeError as e:\n            # If a TypeError is raised, the test should fail\n            self.fail(\"TypeError raised: \" + str(e))\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 219, "prompt_tokens": 1078, "total_tokens": 1297, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
