This is a problem, for example, when you try to save a model object, and a decimal field got set to a dictionary by mistake. The TypeError exception that comes back makes it hard to track the problem to the field if the object has a lot of fields.\\nI am proposing a patch to fix it:\\n\\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/13023\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable. Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db.models import DecimalField\n\nclass DecimalFieldTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_to_python_with_dict_raises_type_error(self):\n        # Initialize a DecimalField instance\n        decimal_field = DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)\n        \n        # Prepare a dictionary object to simulate erroneous input\n        invalid_input = {\"key\": \"value\"}\n        \n        try:\n            # Call to_python() with a dictionary input\n            decimal_field.to_python(invalid_input)\n        except TypeError:\n            # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n            pass\n        else:\n            # If no TypeError is raised, the test should fail\n            self.fail(\"DecimalField.to_python() did not raise TypeError with dict input.\")\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BreqDTz8ZCuTTQKSTAWztmQHgvMut", "created": 1752128077, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db.models import DecimalField\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\n\nclass DecimalFieldTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_to_python_with_dict_raises_validation_error(self):\n        # Initialize a DecimalField instance\n        decimal_field = DecimalField(max_digits=5, decimal_places=2)\n        \n        # Prepare a dictionary object to simulate erroneous input\n        invalid_input = {\"key\": \"value\"}\n        \n        with self.assertRaises(ValidationError):\n            # Call to_python() with a dictionary input\n            decimal_field.to_python(invalid_input)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 646, "total_tokens": 773, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
