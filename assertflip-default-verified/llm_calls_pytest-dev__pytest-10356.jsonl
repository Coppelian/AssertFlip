Your goal is to plan out the creation of one or more test functions that pass but still reproduce and expose the reported bug.\nYou will be provided with a ISSUE TICKET and a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference. Your task is to analyze the described problem in detail and plan your approach to writing the test.\n                       \nFirst, carefully read the ISSUE TICKET and inspect the collected CODE SNIPPETS.\nAnalyze the problem reported critically and plan your approach:\n\n1. Identify the type of bug (exception, logic error, etc.)\n2. Quote relevant parts of the ISSUE TICKET and the CODE SNIPPETS\n3. Determine the expected incorrect behavior\n4. List potential test cases\n5. Consider edge cases and boundary conditions\n6. Outline the structure of the test function\n7. Consider any necessary setup or cleanup steps\n8. Identify any relevant assertions or checks needed\n\n9. Plan how to trigger the bug while ensuring the test passes.  \n10. Your goal is to plan a test that passes (does not fail during execution), but still triggers and exposes the bug as described in the issue ticket. \n11. Plan assertions that will pass while still exposing the bug.\n\n\nCreate a detailed plan for writing the test. Your plan should focus on the logical structure and approach, without delving into specific implementation details of any testing framework. Ensure your plan is thorough and covers all aspects of triggering and exposing the bug.\n\nPresent your plan in the following format:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - [Describe necessary setup steps]\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - [Detail the input data or mock objects required]\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - [Explain how to consistently trigger the bug]\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - [Outline the logical flow of the test]\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - [List the key assertions needed to expose the bug]\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - [Identify any edge cases or variations to consider]\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - [Describe how the test will pass if the bug is present and fail once the bug is fixed ]\n</plan>\n\nIf you need any information that has been trimmed away, or are missing information from the codebase you can use the get_info tool function to obtain it.                       \nYour plan should be detailed and thorough, covering all logical aspects of the problem.\nDO NOT provide implementation specific details pertaining to any testing framework.\nDO NOT write the test yet. \nYOU MUST focus on creating a thorough detailed logical plan on how to trigger the bug and how to structure a test for this particular project.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Carefully read the reported ISSUE TICKET below, analyze the problem critically and create a detailed plan to write tests that reveal the bug.\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n('Consider MRO when obtaining marks for classes\\nWhen using pytest markers in two baseclasses `Foo` and `Bar`, inheriting from both of those baseclasses will lose the markers of one of those classes.

The problem is that markers from one of the base classes are lost due to the method resolution order (MRO) unless a specific metaclass is used. Here's a detailed plan to write tests that reveal this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure that the test environment is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, as the issue is reported to be reproducible in both versions.\n   - Import necessary modules: `pytest` for marking and `itertools` for handling marker lists.\n   - Define a metaclass `BaseMeta` that correctly aggregates markers from the MRO.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create two base classes, `Foo` and `Bar`, each with a unique pytest marker (`@pytest.mark.foo` and `@pytest.mark.bar` respectively).\n   - Define a derived class `TestDings` that inherits from both `Foo` and `Bar`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `TestDings` is instantiated without the `BaseMeta` metaclass, causing it to lose one of the markers due to MRO.\n   - To expose the bug, we will check the markers on `TestDings` both with and without the metaclass.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define a test function `test_dings_markers`.\n   - Within this function, instantiate `TestDings` and retrieve its markers.\n   - First, test without the metaclass to show that only one marker is present.\n   - Then, apply the metaclass and show that both markers are present.\n\n5.

The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9.

The problem is that markers from one of the base classes are lost due to the method resolution order (MRO) unless a specific metaclass is used. Here's a detailed plan to write tests that reveal this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure that the test environment is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, as the issue is reported to be reproducible in both versions.\n   - Import necessary modules: `pytest` for marking and `itertools` for handling marker lists.\n   - Define a metaclass `BaseMeta` that correctly aggregates markers from the MRO.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create two base classes, `Foo` and `Bar`, each with a unique pytest marker (`@pytest.mark.foo` and `@pytest.mark.bar` respectively).\n   - Define a derived class `TestDings` that inherits from both `Foo` and `Bar`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `TestDings` is instantiated without the `BaseMeta` metaclass, causing it to lose one of the markers due to MRO.\n   - To expose the bug, we will check the markers on `TestDings` both with and without the metaclass.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define a test function `test_dings_markers`.\n   - Within this function, instantiate `TestDings` and retrieve its markers.\n   - First, test without the metaclass to show that only one marker is present.\n   - Then, apply the metaclass and show that both markers are present.\n\n5.

The problem is that markers from one of the base classes are lost due to the method resolution order (MRO) unless a specific metaclass is used. Here's a detailed plan to write tests that reveal this bug:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Ensure that the test environment is compatible with both Python 2 and 3, as the issue is reported to be reproducible in both versions.\n   - Import necessary modules: `pytest` for marking and `itertools` for handling marker lists.\n   - Define a metaclass `BaseMeta` that correctly aggregates markers from the MRO.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Create two base classes, `Foo` and `Bar`, each with a unique pytest marker (`@pytest.mark.foo` and `@pytest.mark.bar` respectively).\n   - Define a derived class `TestDings` that inherits from both `Foo` and `Bar`.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - The bug is triggered when `TestDings` is instantiated without the `BaseMeta` metaclass, causing it to lose one of the markers due to MRO.\n   - To expose the bug, we will check the markers on `TestDings` both with and without the metaclass.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Define a test function `test_dings_markers`.\n   - Within this function, instantiate `TestDings` and retrieve its markers.\n   - First, test without the metaclass to show that only one marker is present.\n   - Then, apply the metaclass and show that both markers are present.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that without the metaclass, only one marker (`foo` or `bar`) is present on `TestDings`.\n   - Assert that with the metaclass, both markers (`foo` and `bar`) are present.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider the scenario where additional markers are added to `Foo` or `Bar` after `TestDings` is defined.\n   - Test with different orders of inheritance (e.g., `class TestDings(Bar, Foo)`).\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing that only one marker is present without the metaclass.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test will fail, indicating that both markers are correctly aggregated without needing the metaclass.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to structure the test to expose the issue with marker inheritance due to MRO, ensuring that the test passes by demonstrating the bug and fails once the bug is resolved. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BaseMeta\", \"path\": \"src/_pytest/mark/structures.py\", \"line\": 347}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_lbxdsGv3LMmwTPJAkSclPRKw", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"store_mark\", \"path\": \"src/_pytest/mark/structures.py\", \"line\": 383}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_edNO1f6BlpPDk9rJxB6sJ7bc", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"Node.add_marker\", \"path\": \"src/_pytest/nodes.py\", \"line\": 339}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_ReVlxHzmQDcDixA6hNxG6eZG", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_lbxdsGv3LMmwTPJAkSclPRKw", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on BaseMeta."}, {"tool_call_id": "call_edNO1f6BlpPDk9rJxB6sJ7bc", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\ndef store_mark(obj, mark: Mark) -> None:\n    \"\"\"Store a Mark on an object.\n\n    This is used to implement the Mark declarations/decorators correctly.\n    \"\"\"\n    assert isinstance(mark, Mark), mark\n    obj.pytestmark = [*get_unpacked_marks(obj), mark]\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_ReVlxHzmQDcDixA6hNxG6eZG", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Union\nfrom _pytest.mark.structures import MarkDecorator\n\nclass Node(metaclass=NodeMeta):\n    ...\n\n    def add_marker(self, marker: Union[str, MarkDecorator], append: bool=True) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Dynamically add a marker object to the node.\n\n        :param marker:\n            The marker.\n        :param append:\n            Whether to append the marker, or prepend it.\n        \"\"\"\n        from _pytest.mark import MARK_GEN\n        if isinstance(marker, MarkDecorator):\n            marker_ = marker\n        elif isinstance(marker, str):\n            marker_ = getattr(MARK_GEN, marker)\n        else:\n            raise ValueError('is not a string or pytest.mark.* Marker')\n        self.keywords[marker_.name] = marker_\n        if append:\n            self.own_markers.append(marker_.mark)\n        else:\n            self.own_markers.insert(0, marker_.mark)\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nimport pytest\n\n# Define two base classes with different markers\n@pytest.mark.foo\nclass Foo:\n    pass\n\n@pytest.mark.bar\nclass Bar:\n    pass\n\n# Derived class inheriting from both base classes\nclass TestDings(Foo, Bar):\n    def test_dings(self):\n        pass\n\ndef test_dings_markers():\n    # Retrieve the markers on the TestDings class\n    markers = [mark.name for mark in TestDings.test_dings.pytestmark]\n\n    # Assert that only one marker is present due to MRO\n    # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n    assert len(markers) == 1, \"Expected only one marker due to MRO, exposing the bug\"\n\n    # Assert that the marker is either 'foo' or 'bar'\n    assert markers[0] in ['foo', 'bar'], \"Marker should be either 'foo' or 'bar'\"\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe information obtained confirms that the `store_mark` function is responsible for storing markers on an object by appending them to the `pytestmark` attribute.
