The issue ticket describes a problem where the `cleaned_data` should be able to overwrite a model's default value, but currently, it does not. The test code sets up a model with a default value for a field and a form that modifies this field in the `clean` method. The test then checks if the `cleaned_data` value is applied to the model instance. The test fails because the model instance retains the default value instead of the `cleaned_data` value, which aligns with the reported issue. Therefore, the test correctly reproduces the bug described in the issue ticket.", "revealing": true}}
