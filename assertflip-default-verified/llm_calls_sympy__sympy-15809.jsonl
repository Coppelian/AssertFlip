Test Input:\n   - No arguments should be passed to the `Min()` and `Max()` functions to trigger the current behavior.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call `Min()` and `Max()` without any arguments. This should currently raise a `ValueError` as per the issue description.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - The test should be structured to call `Min()` and `Max()` without arguments.\n   - Use a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` and confirm that it is raised.\n   - Log or print a message indicating that the current behavior is to raise an exception.\n\n5.
