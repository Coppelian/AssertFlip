The `OrderedSet` class does not currently support the `reversed()` function, which is expected to work given that `OrderedSet` maintains order.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - \"Currently, OrderedSet isn't reversible (i.e. allowed to be passed as an argument to Python's reversed()).\"\n   - \"This should be straightforward to add by adding a __reversed__() method to OrderedSet.\"\n\n3. **Relevant Parts of the CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - The `OrderedSet` class is defined starting at line 5 in `django/utils/datastructures.py`.\n   - The class maintains order using a dictionary (`self.dict`), but lacks a `__reversed__()` method.\n\n4. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - Attempting to call `reversed()` on an instance of `OrderedSet` will raise a `TypeError` because the `__reversed__()` method is not implemented.\n\n5. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test calling `reversed()` on a non-empty `OrderedSet`.\n   - Test calling `reversed()` on an empty `OrderedSet`.\n\n6. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - An empty `OrderedSet` should not raise an error when reversed.\n   - A single-element `OrderedSet` should return an iterator with that single element.\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create instances of `OrderedSet` with various elements, including an empty set and a set with multiple elements.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use different `OrderedSet` instances as input to the `reversed()` function.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Directly call `reversed()` on an `OrderedSet` instance to trigger the `TypeError`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize an `OrderedSet` with a known sequence of elements.\n   - Attempt to call `reversed()` on this instance.\n   - Capture any exceptions raised to confirm the absence of `__reversed__()`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised when `reversed()` is called on an `OrderedSet`.\n   - Optionally, check the error message to ensure it indicates the lack of `__reversed__()`.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with an empty `OrderedSet` to ensure no error is raised once the bug is fixed.\n   - Test with a single-element `OrderedSet` to ensure correct behavior once the bug is fixed.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if a `TypeError` is raised, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Once the `__reversed__()` method is implemented, the test should fail, prompting a revision of the test to check for correct reversed order instead.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the current limitation of the `OrderedSet` class regarding the `reversed()` function. The test will initially pass by confirming the absence of the `__reversed__()` method, and it will need to be updated once the feature is implemented. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"OrderedSet\",\"path\":\"django/utils/datastructures.py\",\"line\":5}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_WUTxZ2MmuaB0Br9VCUToEEMx", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_WUTxZ2MmuaB0Br9VCUToEEMx", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nclass OrderedSet:\n    \"\"\"\n    A set which keeps the ordering of the inserted items.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, iterable=None):\n        self.dict = dict.fromkeys(iterable or ())\n\n    def add(self, item):\n        ...\n\n    def remove(self, item):\n        ...\n\n    def discard(self, item):\n        ...\n\n    def __iter__(self):\n        ...\n\n    def __contains__(self, item):\n        ...\n\n    def __bool__(self):\n        ...\n\n    def __len__(self):\n        ...\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\n\nclass OrderedSetReversedTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_reversed_ordered_set_raises_type_error(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Test that calling reversed() on an OrderedSet raises a TypeError.\n        This confirms the absence of the __reversed__() method.\n        \"\"\"\n        ordered_set = OrderedSet([1, 2, 3])\n        \n        with self.assertRaises(TypeError):\n            reversed(ordered_set)\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe `OrderedSet` class does not currently implement a `__reversed__()` method, which is why calling `reversed()` on an instance of `OrderedSet` raises a `TypeError`.
