What I can so far do is retrieve the time it takes to fit and score each model:\\r\\n```\\r\\nimport sklearn.datasets\\r\\nimport sklearn.model_selection\\r\\nimport sklearn.ensemble\\r\\n\\r\\nX, y = sklearn.datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\\r\\n\\r\\nrs = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(\\r\\n    estimator=sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier(),\\r\\n    param_grid={'n_estimators': [2, 3, 4, 5]}\\r\\n)\\r\\nrs.fit(X, y)\\r\\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_fit_time'])\\r\\nprint(rs.cv_results_['mean_score_time'])\\r\\n```\\r\\nIn case I run this on a single core, I could time the whole search procedure and subtract the time it took to fit the single folds during hyperparameter optimization. Nevertheless, this isn't possible any more when setting `n_jobs != 1`.\\r\\n\\r\\nThus, it would be great to have an attribute `refit_time_` which is simply the time it took to refit the best model.\\r\\n\\r\\nUsecase: for [OpenML.org](https://openml.org) we want to support uploading the results of hyperparameter optimization, including the time it takes to do the hyperparameter optimization. \\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\n<TEST_CODE>\nimport pytest\nfrom sklearn.datasets import load_iris\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n\ndef test_missing_refit_time_attribute():\n    # Load a simple dataset\n    X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\n    \n    # Set up the estimator and parameter grid\n    estimator = RandomForestClassifier()\n    param_grid = {'n_estimators': [2, 3]}\n    \n    # Initialize GridSearchCV\n    grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=estimator, param_grid=param_grid, refit=True)\n    \n    # Fit the model\n    grid_search.fit(X, y)\n    \n    # Check if the refit_time_ attribute exists and is a float\n    assert hasattr(grid_search, 'refit_time_'), \"refit_time_ attribute is missing\"\n    assert isinstance(grid_search.refit_time_, float), \"refit_time_ should be a float\"\n\n</TEST_CODE>\n\n<TEST_ERROR>\n    def test_missing_refit_time_attribute():\n        # Load a simple dataset\n        X, y = load_iris(return_X_y=True)\n    \n        # Set up the estimator and parameter grid\n        estimator = RandomForestClassifier()\n        param_grid = {'n_estimators': [2, 3]}\n    \n        # Initialize GridSearchCV\n        grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=estimator, param_grid=param_grid, refit=True)\n    \n        # Fit the model\n        grid_search.fit(X, y)\n    \n        # Check if the refit_time_ attribute exists and is a float\n>       assert hasattr(grid_search, 'refit_time_'), \"refit_time_ attribute is missing\"\nE       AssertionError: refit_time_ attribute is missing\nE       assert False\nE        +  where False = hasattr(GridSearchCV(cv=None, error_score='raise-deprecating',\\n       estimator=RandomForestClassifier(bootstrap=True, class_w...n_estimators': [2, 3]}, pre_dispatch='2*n_jobs',\\n       refit=True, return_train_score='warn', scoring=None, verbose=0), 'refit_time_')\n\nsklearn/tests/test_f1bslbsr.py:21: AssertionError\n\n</TEST_ERROR>\n"}], "response": {"reason": "The test is designed to check for the presence of a 'refit_time_' attribute in the GridSearchCV object after fitting, which is directly related to the issue reported.
