Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django model with a field that has a default value.\n   - Create a form class for this model, ensuring that the form does not include the field with the default value in its data payload.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare form data that excludes the field with the default value.\n   - Mock or set up the `cleaned_data` to include a value for the field that should overwrite the default.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Submit the form with the prepared data.\n   - Ensure that the form processing logic attempts to use `cleaned_data` to set the field's value.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Instantiate the form with the test data.\n   - Call the form's `is_valid()` method to trigger the cleaning process.\n   - Use the `construct_instance` function to apply `cleaned_data` to a model instance.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the field's value in the model instance is equal to the value in `cleaned_data`, not the default value.\n   - This assertion should pass if the bug is present (i.e., the default value is incorrectly used).\n\n6.

Here's a detailed plan for writing such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django model with a field that has a default value.\n   - Create a form class for this model, ensuring that the form does not include the field with the default value in its data payload.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare form data that excludes the field with the default value.\n   - Mock or set up the `cleaned_data` to include a value for the field that should overwrite the default.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Submit the form with the prepared data.\n   - Ensure that the form processing logic attempts to use `cleaned_data` to set the field's value.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Instantiate the form with the test data.\n   - Call the form's `is_valid()` method to trigger the cleaning process.\n   - Use the `construct_instance` function to apply `cleaned_data` to a model instance.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the field's value in the model instance is equal to the value in `cleaned_data`, not the default value.\n   - This assertion should pass if the bug is present (i.e., the default value is incorrectly used).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider a case where the field is included in the form data to ensure normal behavior is unaffected.\n   - Test with different data types for the field (e.g., string, integer) to ensure consistency.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, meaning the field's value in the model instance is incorrectly set to the default value instead of the value from `cleaned_data`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the field's value is correctly set from `cleaned_data`.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a scenario where the form's `cleaned_data` should overwrite a model field's default value, but due to the bug, it does not. The test will pass by confirming the incorrect behavior, thus exposing the bug. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.forms import ModelForm\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Ensure the test model is part of an installed app\nsettings.configure(INSTALLED_APPS=['test_app'])\napps.populate(settings.INSTALLED_APPS)\n\n# Step 1: Create a model with a field that has a default value\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='default_name')\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\n# Step 2: Create a form for this model, excluding the field with the default value\nclass TestModelForm(ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = TestModel\n        fields = []  # Exclude 'name' field\n\n    def clean(self):\n        # Step 3: Set up cleaned_data to include a value for the field\n        cleaned_data = super().clean()\n        cleaned_data['name'] = 'cleaned_name'\n        return cleaned_data\n\nclass TestModelFormTest(TestCase):\n    def test_cleaned_data_overwrites_default(self):\n        # Step 4: Use construct_instance to apply cleaned_data to a model instance\n        form = TestModelForm(data={})\n        form.is_valid()  # Trigger the cleaning process\n        instance = construct_instance(form, TestModel())\n\n        # Step 5: Assert that the field's value is incorrectly set to the default value\n        self.assertEqual(instance.name, 'default_name')  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5.

Here's a detailed plan for writing such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django model with a field that has a default value.\n   - Create a form class for this model, ensuring that the form does not include the field with the default value in its data payload.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare form data that excludes the field with the default value.\n   - Mock or set up the `cleaned_data` to include a value for the field that should overwrite the default.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Submit the form with the prepared data.\n   - Ensure that the form processing logic attempts to use `cleaned_data` to set the field's value.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Instantiate the form with the test data.\n   - Call the form's `is_valid()` method to trigger the cleaning process.\n   - Use the `construct_instance` function to apply `cleaned_data` to a model instance.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the field's value in the model instance is equal to the value in `cleaned_data`, not the default value.\n   - This assertion should pass if the bug is present (i.e., the default value is incorrectly used).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider a case where the field is included in the form data to ensure normal behavior is unaffected.\n   - Test with different data types for the field (e.g., string, integer) to ensure consistency.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, meaning the field's value in the model instance is incorrectly set to the default value instead of the value from `cleaned_data`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the field's value is correctly set from `cleaned_data`.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a scenario where the form's `cleaned_data` should overwrite a model field's default value, but due to the bug, it does not. The test will pass by confirming the incorrect behavior, thus exposing the bug. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.forms import ModelForm\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Step 1: Create a model with a field that has a default value\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='default_name')\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\n# Step 2: Create a form for this model, excluding the field with the default value\nclass TestModelForm(ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = TestModel\n        fields = []  # Exclude 'name' field\n\n    def clean(self):\n        # Step 3: Set up cleaned_data to include a value for the field\n        cleaned_data = super().clean()\n        cleaned_data['name'] = 'cleaned_name'\n        return cleaned_data\n\nclass TestModelFormTest(TestCase):\n    def test_cleaned_data_overwrites_default(self):\n        # Step 4: Use construct_instance to apply cleaned_data to a model instance\n        form = TestModelForm(data={})\n        form.is_valid()  # Trigger the cleaning process\n        instance = construct_instance(form, TestModel())\n\n        # Step 5: Assert that the field's value is incorrectly set to the default value\n        self.assertEqual(instance.name, 'default_name')  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Your goal is: Write a test that PASSES but exposes the bug \u2014 the test must pass when run, but clearly demonstrate that the bug is present.\nYou will be provided with an ISSUE TICKET, a set of CODE SNIPPETS which might contain the buggy logic and examples of tests in the project for reference, and a PLAN made by your supervisor.\n\nReview the PLAN and create a Python test script that meets the following requirements:\n\n\n1. The test must trigger the same error or misbehavior described in the ISSUE TICKET.\n2. The test must pass when executed but confirm that the bug occurs.\n3. Use appropriate testing structures:\n   - For exceptions: Use pytest.raises(...) or equivalent logic.\n   - For logic bugs: Assert that the incorrect behavior occurs.\n4. Include comments to explain any assertions of incorrect behavior:\n   # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n5. Use the get_info tool function if necessary to obtain information about the buggy code.\n6. Include cleanup steps to avoid state pollution (use 'monkeypatch' or 'pytest-mock' if appropriate).\n7. Minimize top-level code. Do not include code calling pytest.main or the test itself.\n8. Ensure the test is complete and can be executed as-is, without placeholders or user intervention.\n9. Do not write tests that simply pass without relevance to the bug. Your test must pass, but it must also be directly relevant to the bug and expose the buggy behavior.\n\n\nImportant constraints:\n- Do not install new packages or modules.\n- Do not request additional information from the user.\n- The test must be directly relevant to the reported bug.\n- The tests must be complete and executable. DO NOT include any placeholders.\n- Do NOT use or import pytest you must use django.test\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.test.utils import isolate_apps\n\n@isolate_apps(\"absolute_url_overrides\")\nclass AbsoluteUrlOverrideTests(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_get_absolute_url(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        get_absolute_url() functions as a normal method.\n        \"\"\"\n\n        def get_absolute_url(o):\n            return \"/test-a/%s/\" % o.pk\n\n        TestA = self._create_model_class(\"TestA\", get_absolute_url)\n\n        self.assertTrue(hasattr(TestA, \"get_absolute_url\"))\n        obj = TestA(pk=1, name=\"Foo\")\n        self.assertEqual(\"/test-a/%s/\" % obj.pk, obj.get_absolute_url())\n```\n\n\nYou are not expected to follow the plan exactly, but it should guide your implementation.

Here's a detailed plan for writing such a test:\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Create a Django model with a field that has a default value.\n   - Create a form class for this model, ensuring that the form does not include the field with the default value in its data payload.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Prepare form data that excludes the field with the default value.\n   - Mock or set up the `cleaned_data` to include a value for the field that should overwrite the default.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Submit the form with the prepared data.\n   - Ensure that the form processing logic attempts to use `cleaned_data` to set the field's value.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Instantiate the form with the test data.\n   - Call the form's `is_valid()` method to trigger the cleaning process.\n   - Use the `construct_instance` function to apply `cleaned_data` to a model instance.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the field's value in the model instance is equal to the value in `cleaned_data`, not the default value.\n   - This assertion should pass if the bug is present (i.e., the default value is incorrectly used).\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider a case where the field is included in the form data to ensure normal behavior is unaffected.\n   - Test with different data types for the field (e.g., string, integer) to ensure consistency.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present, meaning the field's value in the model instance is incorrectly set to the default value instead of the value from `cleaned_data`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the field's value is correctly set from `cleaned_data`.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a scenario where the form's `cleaned_data` should overwrite a model field's default value, but due to the bug, it does not. The test will pass by confirming the incorrect behavior, thus exposing the bug. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.forms import ModelForm\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.forms.models import construct_instance\n\n# Step 1: Create a model with a field that has a default value\nclass TestModel(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, default='default_name')\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\n# Step 2: Create a form for this model, excluding the field with the default value\nclass TestModelForm(ModelForm):\n    class Meta:\n        model = TestModel\n        fields = []  # Exclude 'name' field\n\n    def clean(self):\n        # Step 3: Set up cleaned_data to include a value for the field\n        cleaned_data = super().clean()\n        cleaned_data['name'] = 'cleaned_name'\n        return cleaned_data\n\nclass TestModelFormTest(TestCase):\n    def test_cleaned_data_overwrites_default(self):\n        # Step 4: Use construct_instance to apply cleaned_data to a model instance\n        form = TestModelForm(data={})\n        form.is_valid()  # Trigger the cleaning process\n        instance = construct_instance(form, TestModel())\n\n        # Step 5: Assert that the field's value is incorrectly set to the default value\n        self.assertEqual(instance.name, 'default_name')  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.
