The problem is that the data from these fields is not being saved because the `save_m2m()` method is not called in the `save()` method of `UserCreationForm`.\n\nLet's break down the problem and plan a test to expose this bug:\n\n1. **Identify the type of bug**: \n   - This is a logic error. The `save()` method in `UserCreationForm` does not call `self.save_m2m()`, which is necessary to save data from `ManyToManyField` fields.\n\n2. **Relevant parts of the ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - From the ISSUE TICKET: \"UserCreationForm.save(commit=True) omits to call self.save_m2m().\"\n   - From the CODE SNIPPETS: The `save()` method in `UserCreationForm` (lines 139-144) does not include a call to `self.save_m2m()`.\n\n3. **Expected incorrect behavior**:\n   - When using `UserCreationForm` with a custom User model that has `ManyToManyField` fields, the data in these fields will not be saved to the database.\n\n4. **Potential test cases**:\n   - Test creating a user with a `ManyToManyField` and verify that the related data is not saved.\n   - Test with different configurations of `ManyToManyField` to ensure the issue is consistent.\n\n5. **Edge cases and boundary conditions**:\n   - Consider a scenario where no `ManyToManyField` data is provided to ensure the form still functions without error.\n   - Test with multiple `ManyToManyField` fields to see if the issue persists across all fields.\n\n6. **Outline the structure of the test function**:\n   - Setup a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Create a `UserCreationForm` instance with data for the `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Call the `save()` method on the form.\n   - Check if the `ManyToManyField` data is saved.\n\n7. **Consider any necessary setup or cleanup steps**:\n   - Setup: Define a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Cleanup: Ensure any created database entries are removed after the test.\n\n8. **Identify any relevant assertions or checks needed**:\n   - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved in the database after calling `save()`.\n\n9. **Plan how to trigger the bug while ensuring the test passes**:\n   - The test should pass by confirming that the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved, which is the current incorrect behavior.\n\n10. **Plan assertions that will pass while still exposing the bug**:\n    - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is missing from the database, which will pass if the bug is present.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Create a test database entry for the related model.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Provide data for the `ManyToManyField` when creating a `UserCreationForm` instance.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `save()` method on the `UserCreationForm` instance without manually calling `save_m2m()`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the form with data.\n   - Call the `save()` method.\n   - Check the database for the presence of `ManyToManyField` data.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is not present in the database.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with no `ManyToManyField` data to ensure no errors occur.\n   - Test with multiple `ManyToManyField` fields.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved, exposing the bug. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the data is now correctly saved.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"UserCreationForm\", \"path\": \"django/contrib/auth/forms.py\", \"line\": 139}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_0PkDRvcuvn8IbuBmQnhhRvqi", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"save_m2m\", \"path\": \"django/contrib/auth/forms.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_hvRitk96pIGi1nsPs5EXpS3W", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_0PkDRvcuvn8IbuBmQnhhRvqi", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django import forms\nfrom django.contrib.auth import password_validation\nfrom django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n\nclass UserCreationForm(forms.ModelForm):\n    \"\"\"\n    A form that creates a user, with no privileges, from the given username and\n    password.\n    \"\"\"\n    error_messages = {'password_mismatch': _('The two password fields didn\u2019t match.')}\n    password1 = forms.CharField(label=_('Password'), strip=False, widget=forms.PasswordInput(attrs={'autocomplete': 'new-password'}), help_text=password_validation.password_validators_help_text_html())\n    password2 = forms.CharField(label=_('Password confirmation'), widget=forms.PasswordInput(attrs={'autocomplete': 'new-password'}), strip=False, help_text=_('Enter the same password as before, for verification.'))\n\n    class Meta:\n        ...\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)\n        if self._meta.model.USERNAME_FIELD in self.fields:\n            self.fields[self._meta.model.USERNAME_FIELD].widget.attrs['autofocus'] = True\n\n    def clean_password2(self):\n        ...\n\n    def _post_clean(self):\n        ...\n\n    def save(self, commit=True):\n        ...\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_hvRitk96pIGi1nsPs5EXpS3W", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "Unable to obtain information on save_m2m."}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\nfrom django.db import models\n\n# Custom User model with a ManyToManyField\nclass Group(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\nclass CustomUser(get_user_model()):\n    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group)\n\nclass UserCreationFormTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create some group instances to use in the test\n        self.group1 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 1\")\n        self.group2 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 2\")\n\n    def test_user_creation_form_m2m_not_saved(self):\n        # Data for the form, including ManyToManyField data\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password1': 'complexpassword123',\n            'password2': 'complexpassword123',\n            'groups': [self.group1.id, self.group2.id]\n        }\n        form = UserCreationForm(data=form_data)\n\n        # Check if the form is valid\n        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())\n\n        # Save the form\n        user = form.save()\n\n        # Check that the ManyToManyField data is not saved\n        self.assertEqual(user.groups.count(), 0)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "reasoning_content": "\nThe `UserCreationForm` class is a subclass of `forms.ModelForm`, and it has a `save` method that does not call `self.save_m2m()`.

The problem is that the data from these fields is not being saved because the `save_m2m()` method is not called in the `save()` method of `UserCreationForm`.\n\nLet's break down the problem and plan a test to expose this bug:\n\n1. **Identify the type of bug**: \n   - This is a logic error. The `save()` method in `UserCreationForm` does not call `self.save_m2m()`, which is necessary to save data from `ManyToManyField` fields.\n\n2. **Relevant parts of the ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - From the ISSUE TICKET: \"UserCreationForm.save(commit=True) omits to call self.save_m2m().\"\n   - From the CODE SNIPPETS: The `save()` method in `UserCreationForm` (lines 139-144) does not include a call to `self.save_m2m()`.\n\n3. **Expected incorrect behavior**:\n   - When using `UserCreationForm` with a custom User model that has `ManyToManyField` fields, the data in these fields will not be saved to the database.\n\n4. **Potential test cases**:\n   - Test creating a user with a `ManyToManyField` and verify that the related data is not saved.\n   - Test with different configurations of `ManyToManyField` to ensure the issue is consistent.\n\n5. **Edge cases and boundary conditions**:\n   - Consider a scenario where no `ManyToManyField` data is provided to ensure the form still functions without error.\n   - Test with multiple `ManyToManyField` fields to see if the issue persists across all fields.\n\n6. **Outline the structure of the test function**:\n   - Setup a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Create a `UserCreationForm` instance with data for the `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Call the `save()` method on the form.\n   - Check if the `ManyToManyField` data is saved.\n\n7. **Consider any necessary setup or cleanup steps**:\n   - Setup: Define a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Cleanup: Ensure any created database entries are removed after the test.\n\n8. **Identify any relevant assertions or checks needed**:\n   - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved in the database after calling `save()`.\n\n9. **Plan how to trigger the bug while ensuring the test passes**:\n   - The test should pass by confirming that the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved, which is the current incorrect behavior.\n\n10. **Plan assertions that will pass while still exposing the bug**:\n    - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is missing from the database, which will pass if the bug is present.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Create a test database entry for the related model.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Provide data for the `ManyToManyField` when creating a `UserCreationForm` instance.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `save()` method on the `UserCreationForm` instance without manually calling `save_m2m()`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the form with data.\n   - Call the `save()` method.\n   - Check the database for the presence of `ManyToManyField` data.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is not present in the database.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with no `ManyToManyField` data to ensure no errors occur.\n   - Test with multiple `ManyToManyField` fields.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved, exposing the bug. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the data is now correctly saved.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Define a custom app config to register the test models\nclass TestAppConfig(apps.AppConfig):\n    name = 'test_app'\n    label = 'test_app'\n\n# Register the app config\napps.app_configs[TestAppConfig.label] = TestAppConfig()\napps.apps_ready = True\napps.clear_cache()\n\n# Custom User model with a ManyToManyField\nclass Group(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass CustomUser(get_user_model()):\n    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass UserCreationFormTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create some group instances to use in the test\n        self.group1 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 1\")\n        self.group2 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 2\")\n\n    def test_user_creation_form_m2m_not_saved(self):\n        # Data for the form, including ManyToManyField data\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password1': 'complexpassword123',\n            'password2': 'complexpassword123',\n            'groups': [self.group1.id, self.group2.id]\n        }\n        form = UserCreationForm(data=form_data)\n\n        # Check if the form is valid\n        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())\n\n        # Save the form\n        user = form.save()\n\n        # Check that the ManyToManyField data is not saved\n        self.assertEqual(user.groups.count(), 0)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

The problem is that the data from these fields is not being saved because the `save_m2m()` method is not called in the `save()` method of `UserCreationForm`.\n\nLet's break down the problem and plan a test to expose this bug:\n\n1. **Identify the type of bug**: \n   - This is a logic error. The `save()` method in `UserCreationForm` does not call `self.save_m2m()`, which is necessary to save data from `ManyToManyField` fields.\n\n2. **Relevant parts of the ISSUE TICKET and CODE SNIPPETS**:\n   - From the ISSUE TICKET: \"UserCreationForm.save(commit=True) omits to call self.save_m2m().\"\n   - From the CODE SNIPPETS: The `save()` method in `UserCreationForm` (lines 139-144) does not include a call to `self.save_m2m()`.\n\n3. **Expected incorrect behavior**:\n   - When using `UserCreationForm` with a custom User model that has `ManyToManyField` fields, the data in these fields will not be saved to the database.\n\n4. **Potential test cases**:\n   - Test creating a user with a `ManyToManyField` and verify that the related data is not saved.\n   - Test with different configurations of `ManyToManyField` to ensure the issue is consistent.\n\n5. **Edge cases and boundary conditions**:\n   - Consider a scenario where no `ManyToManyField` data is provided to ensure the form still functions without error.\n   - Test with multiple `ManyToManyField` fields to see if the issue persists across all fields.\n\n6. **Outline the structure of the test function**:\n   - Setup a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Create a `UserCreationForm` instance with data for the `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Call the `save()` method on the form.\n   - Check if the `ManyToManyField` data is saved.\n\n7. **Consider any necessary setup or cleanup steps**:\n   - Setup: Define a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Cleanup: Ensure any created database entries are removed after the test.\n\n8. **Identify any relevant assertions or checks needed**:\n   - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved in the database after calling `save()`.\n\n9. **Plan how to trigger the bug while ensuring the test passes**:\n   - The test should pass by confirming that the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved, which is the current incorrect behavior.\n\n10. **Plan assertions that will pass while still exposing the bug**:\n    - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is missing from the database, which will pass if the bug is present.\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Define a custom User model with a `ManyToManyField`.\n   - Create a test database entry for the related model.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Provide data for the `ManyToManyField` when creating a `UserCreationForm` instance.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Call the `save()` method on the `UserCreationForm` instance without manually calling `save_m2m()`.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Initialize the form with data.\n   - Call the `save()` method.\n   - Check the database for the presence of `ManyToManyField` data.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that the `ManyToManyField` data is not present in the database.\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Test with no `ManyToManyField` data to ensure no errors occur.\n   - Test with multiple `ManyToManyField` fields.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `ManyToManyField` data is not saved, exposing the bug. Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating the data is now correctly saved.\n</plan> </PLAN> "}, {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth import get_user_model\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\nfrom django.db import models\nfrom django.apps import apps\nfrom django.conf import settings\n\n# Ensure the test app is in INSTALLED_APPS\nif not apps.is_installed('test_app'):\n    settings.INSTALLED_APPS += ('test_app',)\n\n# Custom User model with a ManyToManyField\nclass Group(models.Model):\n    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass CustomUser(get_user_model()):\n    groups = models.ManyToManyField(Group)\n\n    class Meta:\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\nclass UserCreationFormTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create some group instances to use in the test\n        self.group1 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 1\")\n        self.group2 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 2\")\n\n    def test_user_creation_form_m2m_not_saved(self):\n        # Data for the form, including ManyToManyField data\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password1': 'complexpassword123',\n            'password2': 'complexpassword123',\n            'groups': [self.group1.id, self.group2.id]\n        }\n        form = UserCreationForm(data=form_data)\n\n        # Check if the form is valid\n        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())\n\n        # Save the form\n        user = form.save()\n\n        # Check that the ManyToManyField data is not saved\n        self.assertEqual(user.groups.count(), 0)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"role": "user", "content": "Executing the test yields an error, shown below.\nThe test fails.

Keep it minimal.\n\t6.\tThe test must fail as long as the bug is still in the code.\n\t7.\tThe test must pass once the bug is fixed.\n\nOutput the full updated test code in a single python code block \u2014 no extra text, no placeholders.\n"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Please review the passing test below and make minimal modifications to ensure it fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\n\nclass UserCreationFormTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create some group instances to use in the test\n        self.group1 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 1\")\n        self.group2 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 2\")\n\n    def test_user_creation_form_m2m_not_saved(self):\n        # Data for the form, including ManyToManyField data\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password1': 'complexpassword123',\n            'password2': 'complexpassword123',\n            'groups': [self.group1.id, self.group2.id]\n        }\n        form = UserCreationForm(data=form_data)\n\n        # Check if the form is valid\n        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())\n\n        # Save the form\n        user = form.save()\n\n        # Check that the ManyToManyField data is not saved\n        self.assertEqual(user.groups.count(), 0)  # BUG: this behavior is incorrect but currently happens due to the bug\n\n```\n"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BriprTtXId002IlEA2V1qJMPUEsFY", "created": 1752143431, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "```python\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User, Group\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserCreationForm\n\nclass UserCreationFormTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create some group instances to use in the test\n        self.group1 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 1\")\n        self.group2 = Group.objects.create(name=\"Group 2\")\n\n    def test_user_creation_form_m2m_not_saved(self):\n        # Data for the form, including ManyToManyField data\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password1': 'complexpassword123',\n            'password2': 'complexpassword123',\n            'groups': [self.group1.id, self.group2.id]\n        }\n        form = UserCreationForm(data=form_data)\n\n        # Check if the form is valid\n        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())\n\n        # Save the form\n        user = form.save()\n\n        # Check that the ManyToManyField data is saved\n        self.assertEqual(user.groups.count(), 2)  # Correct behavior: should be 2 when the bug is fixed\n```", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 242, "prompt_tokens": 737, "total_tokens": 979, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}
