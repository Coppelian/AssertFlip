The bug is an exception, specifically a `TypeError` due to an invalid comparison of a complex number `I`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The error occurs when calling `simplify(cos(x)**I)`.\n   - The traceback indicates the error arises in the `fu.py` file, specifically in the `_TR56` function where a comparison `rv.exp < 0` is made.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function attempts to compare a complex exponent `I` with an integer, which is not valid and raises a `TypeError`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the `simplify` function with `cos(x)**I` to reproduce the error.\n   - Test with other trigonometric functions raised to complex powers to see if the issue is isolated to `cos` or more general.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider cases where the exponent is purely imaginary, purely real, or a combination of both.\n   - Test with other complex numbers besides `I`.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize the necessary symbols and expressions.\n   - Call the `simplify` function with the problematic input.\n   - Capture the exception and verify it matches the expected `TypeError`.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond initializing the symbols and expressions.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `TypeError` is raised with the message \"Invalid comparison of complex I\".\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary functions and classes from `sympy`.\n   - Define the symbol `x` using `Symbol('x')`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the expression `cos(x)**I` as the input to the `simplify` function.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Directly call `simplify(cos(x)**I)` to trigger the bug, as this is the input that causes the exception.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up the symbol `x`.\n   - Attempt to simplify the expression `cos(x)**I`.\n   - Use a try-except block to catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised.\n   - Verify that the exception message is \"Invalid comparison of complex I\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider additional tests with `sin(x)**I`, `tan(x)**I`, and other trigonometric functions.\n   - Test with other complex exponents like `2*I`, `I + 1`, etc.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised with the correct message, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as no exception should be raised for valid simplification.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by reproducing the conditions under which the error occurs, while ensuring the test passes by correctly handling the expected exception.", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": null, "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, "provider_specific_fields": {"content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}}], "usage": {"completion_tokens": 693, "prompt_tokens": 3012, "total_tokens": 3705, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}, "service_tier": null, "prompt_filter_results": [{"prompt_index": 0, "content_filter_results": {"hate": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "self_harm": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "sexual": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}, "violence": {"filtered": false, "severity": "safe"}}}]}}

The bug is an exception, specifically a `TypeError` due to an invalid comparison of a complex number `I`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The error occurs when calling `simplify(cos(x)**I)`.\n   - The traceback indicates the error arises in the `fu.py` file, specifically in the `_TR56` function where a comparison `rv.exp < 0` is made.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function attempts to compare a complex exponent `I` with an integer, which is not valid and raises a `TypeError`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the `simplify` function with `cos(x)**I` to reproduce the error.\n   - Test with other trigonometric functions raised to complex powers to see if the issue is isolated to `cos` or more general.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider cases where the exponent is purely imaginary, purely real, or a combination of both.\n   - Test with other complex numbers besides `I`.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize the necessary symbols and expressions.\n   - Call the `simplify` function with the problematic input.\n   - Capture the exception and verify it matches the expected `TypeError`.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond initializing the symbols and expressions.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `TypeError` is raised with the message \"Invalid comparison of complex I\".\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary functions and classes from `sympy`.\n   - Define the symbol `x` using `Symbol('x')`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the expression `cos(x)**I` as the input to the `simplify` function.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Directly call `simplify(cos(x)**I)` to trigger the bug, as this is the input that causes the exception.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up the symbol `x`.\n   - Attempt to simplify the expression `cos(x)**I`.\n   - Use a try-except block to catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised.\n   - Verify that the exception message is \"Invalid comparison of complex I\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider additional tests with `sin(x)**I`, `tan(x)**I`, and other trigonometric functions.\n   - Test with other complex exponents like `2*I`, `I + 1`, etc.\n\n7. Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the `TypeError` is raised with the correct message, indicating the bug is present.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, as no exception should be raised for valid simplification.\n</plan>\n\nThis plan outlines how to create a test that will expose the bug by reproducing the conditions under which the error occurs, while ensuring the test passes by correctly handling the expected exception. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\":\"simplify\",\"path\":\"sympy/simplify/simplify.py\"}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_izuzHhaUVOZOdCp15JLcR9H7", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_izuzHhaUVOZOdCp15JLcR9H7", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom sympy.core import Basic, S, Add, Mul, Pow, sympify, expand_mul, Function, Expr, factor_terms, expand_power_exp\nfrom sympy.core.function import expand_log, count_ops, _mexpand, nfloat\nfrom sympy.core.numbers import Float\nfrom sympy.core.rules import Transform\nfrom sympy.functions import gamma, log, piecewise_fold\nfrom sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import CombinatorialFunction\nfrom sympy.functions.elementary.exponential import ExpBase\nfrom sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import HyperbolicFunction\nfrom sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import TrigonometricFunction\nfrom sympy.polys import together, cancel\nfrom sympy.simplify.combsimp import combsimp\nfrom sympy.simplify.powsimp import powsimp\nfrom sympy.simplify.radsimp import radsimp, fraction\nfrom sympy.simplify.trigsimp import trigsimp, exptrigsimp\nfrom sympy.utilities.iterables import has_variety\n\ndef simplify(expr, ratio=1.7, measure=count_ops, rational=False, inverse=False):\n    \"\"\"Simplifies the given expression.\n\n    Simplification is not a well defined term and the exact strategies\n    this function tries can change in the future versions of SymPy. If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(1 - log(a)))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats.

The bug is an exception, specifically a `TypeError` due to an invalid comparison of a complex number `I`.\n\n2. **Relevant Parts of the ISSUE TICKET**:\n   - The error occurs when calling `simplify(cos(x)**I)`.\n   - The traceback indicates the error arises in the `fu.py` file, specifically in the `_TR56` function where a comparison `rv.exp < 0` is made.\n\n3. **Expected Incorrect Behavior**:\n   - The function attempts to compare a complex exponent `I` with an integer, which is not valid and raises a `TypeError`.\n\n4. **Potential Test Cases**:\n   - Test the `simplify` function with `cos(x)**I` to reproduce the error.\n   - Test with other trigonometric functions raised to complex powers to see if the issue is isolated to `cos` or more general.\n\n5. **Edge Cases and Boundary Conditions**:\n   - Consider cases where the exponent is purely imaginary, purely real, or a combination of both.\n   - Test with other complex numbers besides `I`.\n\n6. **Outline the Structure of the Test Function**:\n   - Initialize the necessary symbols and expressions.\n   - Call the `simplify` function with the problematic input.\n   - Capture the exception and verify it matches the expected `TypeError`.\n\n7. **Setup or Cleanup Steps**:\n   - No special setup or cleanup is required beyond initializing the symbols and expressions.\n\n8. **Assertions or Checks Needed**:\n   - Assert that the `TypeError` is raised with the message \"Invalid comparison of complex I\".\n\n### Plan\n\n<plan>\n1. Test Setup:\n   - Import necessary functions and classes from `sympy`.\n   - Define the symbol `x` using `Symbol('x')`.\n\n2. Test Input:\n   - Use the expression `cos(x)**I` as the input to the `simplify` function.\n\n3. Bug Triggering:\n   - Directly call `simplify(cos(x)**I)` to trigger the bug, as this is the input that causes the exception.\n\n4. Test Structure:\n   - Begin the test by setting up the symbol `x`.\n   - Attempt to simplify the expression `cos(x)**I`.\n   - Use a try-except block to catch the `TypeError`.\n\n5. Assertions:\n   - Assert that a `TypeError` is raised.\n   - Verify that the exception message is \"Invalid comparison of complex I\".\n\n6. Edge Cases:\n   - Consider additional tests with `sin(x)**I`, `tan(x)**I`, and other trigonometric functions.\n   - Test with other complex exponents like `2*I`, `I + 1`, etc.\n\n7.

If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\n    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\n    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\n    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\n    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\n    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\n    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\n    :func:`count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\n    expression.\n\n    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\n    than input.\n\n    ::\n\n        >>> from sympy import sqrt, simplify, count_ops, oo\n        >>> root = 1/(sqrt(2)+3)\n\n    Since ``simplify(root)`` would result in a slightly longer expression,\n    root is returned unchanged instead::\n\n       >>> simplify(root, ratio=1) == root\n       True\n\n    If ``ratio=oo``, simplify will be applied anyway::\n\n        >>> count_ops(simplify(root, ratio=oo)) > count_ops(root)\n        True\n\n    Note that the shortest expression is not necessary the simplest, so\n    setting ``ratio`` to 1 may not be a good idea.\n    Heuristically, the default value ``ratio=1.7`` seems like a reasonable\n    choice.\n\n    You can easily define your own measure function based on what you feel\n    should represent the \"size\" or \"complexity\" of the input expression.  Note\n    that some choices, such as ``lambda expr: len(str(expr))`` may appear to be\n    good metrics, but have other problems (in this case, the measure function\n    may slow down simplify too much for very large expressions).  If you don't\n    know what a good metric would be, the default, ``count_ops``, is a good\n    one.\n\n    For example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import symbols, log\n    >>> a, b = symbols('a b', positive=True)\n    >>> g = log(a) + log(b) + log(a)*log(1/b)\n    >>> h = simplify(g)\n    >>> h\n    log(a*b**(1 - log(a)))\n    >>> count_ops(g)\n    8\n    >>> count_ops(h)\n    5\n\n    So you can see that ``h`` is simpler than ``g`` using the count_ops metric.\n    However, we may not like how ``simplify`` (in this case, using\n    ``logcombine``) has created the ``b**(log(1/a) + 1)`` term.  A simple way\n    to reduce this would be to give more weight to powers as operations in\n    ``count_ops``.  We can do this by using the ``visual=True`` option:\n\n    >>> print(count_ops(g, visual=True))\n    2*ADD + DIV + 4*LOG + MUL\n    >>> print(count_ops(h, visual=True))\n    2*LOG + MUL + POW + SUB\n\n    >>> from sympy import Symbol, S\n    >>> def my_measure(expr):\n    ...     POW = Symbol('POW')\n    ...     # Discourage powers by giving POW a weight of 10\n    ...     count = count_ops(expr, visual=True).subs(POW, 10)\n    ...     # Every other operation gets a weight of 1 (the default)\n    ...     count = count.replace(Symbol, type(S.One))\n    ...     return count\n    >>> my_measure(g)\n    8\n    >>> my_measure(h)\n    14\n    >>> 15./8 > 1.7 # 1.7 is the default ratio\n    True\n    >>> simplify(g, measure=my_measure)\n    -log(a)*log(b) + log(a) + log(b)\n\n    Note that because ``simplify()`` internally tries many different\n    simplification strategies and then compares them using the measure\n    function, we get a completely different result that is still different\n    from the input expression by doing this.\n\n    If rational=True, Floats will be recast as Rationals before simplification.\n    If rational=None, Floats will be recast as Rationals but the result will\n    be recast as Floats. If rational=False(default) then nothing will be done\n    to the Floats.\n\n    If inverse=True, it will be assumed that a composition of inverse\n    functions, such as sin and asin, can be cancelled in any order.\n    For example, ``asin(sin(x))`` will yield ``x`` without checking whether\n    x belongs to the set where this relation is true.
