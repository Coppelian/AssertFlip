This allows field alterations to work as expected during in between operations.\\nIn some cases, this introduced two operations that can actually easily be reduced to one.\\nSee for instance the test case: \\u200bhttps://github.com/django/django/pull/14722/files#diff-506caa00017053ff8278de6efc2e59cc0c5cea22da9461482bdf16a9fc50af9eR1573-R1592\\nExample:\\n operations = [\\n\\t migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\\n\\t\\t name=\\'mymodel\\',\\n\\t\\t unique_together=set(),\\n\\t ),\\n\\t migrations.AlterIndexTogether(\\n\\t\\t name=\\'mymodel\\',\\n\\t\\t index_together=set(),\\n\\t ),\\n\\t migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\\n\\t\\t name=\\'mymodel\\',\\n\\t\\t unique_together={(\"col\",)},\\n\\t ),\\n\\t migrations.AlterIndexTogether(\\n\\t\\t name=\\'mymodel\\',\\n\\t\\t index_together={(\"col\",)},\\n\\t ),\\n ]\\nshould be optimized to\\n operations = [\\n\\t migrations.AlterUniqueTogether(\\n\\t\\t name=\\'mymodel\\',\\n\\t\\t unique_together={(\"col\",)},\\n\\t ),\\n\\t migrations.AlterIndexTogether(\\n\\t\\t name=\\'mymodel\\',\\n\\t\\t index_together={(\"col\",)},\\n\\t ),\\n ]\\nSo that we don\\'t do two operations on each constraint, but only one.\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\n<TEST_CODE>\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.db.migrations.optimizer import MigrationOptimizer\nfrom django.db.migrations.operations.models import AlterUniqueTogether, AlterIndexTogether\n\nclass MigrationOptimizerTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_optimize_redundant_operations(self):\n        # Setup: Create a list of redundant operations\n        operations = [\n            AlterUniqueTogether(name='mymodel', unique_together=set()),\n            AlterIndexTogether(name='mymodel', index_together=set()),\n            AlterUniqueTogether(name='mymodel', unique_together={(\"col\",)}),\n            AlterIndexTogether(name='mymodel', index_together={(\"col\",)}),\n        ]\n\n        # Initialize the MigrationOptimizer\n        optimizer = MigrationOptimizer()\n\n        # Mock app label\n        app_label = 'test_app'\n\n        # Call the optimize method\n        optimized_operations = optimizer.optimize(operations, app_label)\n\n        # Assertions to expose the bug\n        # The length of optimized_operations should be 2 after optimization\n        self.assertEqual(len(optimized_operations), 2)\n\n        # The first operation should be AlterUniqueTogether with unique_together={(\"col\",)}\n        self.assertIsInstance(optimized_operations[0], AlterUniqueTogether)\n        self.assertEqual(optimized_operations[0].unique_together, {(\"col\",)})\n\n        # The second operation should be AlterIndexTogether with index_together={(\"col\",)}\n        self.assertIsInstance(optimized_operations[1], AlterIndexTogether)\n        self.assertEqual(optimized_operations[1].index_together, {(\"col\",)})\n\n</TEST_CODE>\n\n<TEST_ERROR>\ntest_optimize_redundant_operations (test_4stwh5x5.MigrationOptimizerTest) ...

The issue ticket explains that multiple operations for altering constraints should be optimized into a single operation for each constraint type. The test sets up a scenario with redundant operations and uses the MigrationOptimizer to attempt to reduce them. The test then asserts that the number of operations should be reduced to two, one for each constraint type, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the issue. The test failure indicates that the optimizer did not perform the expected reduction, as the length of the optimized operations is still 4 instead of 2. This suggests that the test correctly reproduces the bug described in the issue ticket, as the optimizer is not functioning as intended to combine the operations.", "revealing": true}}
