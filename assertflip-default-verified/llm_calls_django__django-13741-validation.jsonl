It is also documented that custom forms for the User model need to define this method: \\u200bhttps://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/customizing/#a-full-example\\nA while ago the forms.Field base class gained the \\u200bdisabled argument to:\\n[disable] a form field using the disabled HTML attribute so that it won\u2019t be editable by users. Even if a user tampers with the field\u2019s value submitted to the server, it will be ignored in favor of the value from the form\u2019s initial data.\\nIt seems to me that this property could be set to True be default on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField used to display the password hash. This way the clean_password is no longer necessary and the potential pitfall when using the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField without implementing clean_password is removed.\\n',)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\n<TEST_CODE>\nfrom django.test import TestCase\nfrom django.contrib.auth.models import User\nfrom django.contrib.auth.forms import UserChangeForm\n\nclass ReadOnlyPasswordHashFieldTest(TestCase):\n    def setUp(self):\n        # Create a user instance with a known password hash\n        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', password='testpassword')\n        self.user.set_password('testpassword')\n        self.user.save()\n\n    def test_read_only_password_hash_field_disabled(self):\n        # Initialize the form with the user instance\n        form = UserChangeForm(instance=self.user)\n\n        # Check if the 'disabled' attribute is set on the ReadOnlyPasswordHashField\n        password_field = form.fields['password']\n        self.assertTrue(password_field.widget.attrs.get('disabled', False))\n\n    def test_clean_password_method_necessity(self):\n        # Simulate form data with a tampered password field\n        form_data = {\n            'username': 'testuser',\n            'password': 'tamperedpassword',\n        }\n        form = UserChangeForm(data=form_data, instance=self.user)\n\n        # Check if the form's cleaned data returns the initial password hash\n        form.is_valid()  # Ensure form validation is called\n        self.assertNotEqual(form.cleaned_data.get('password'), form_data['password'])\n\n</TEST_CODE>\n\n<TEST_ERROR>\nTesting against Django installed in '/testbed/django'\nSkipping setup of unused database(s): other.\nOperations to perform:\n  Synchronize unmigrated apps: auth, contenttypes, messages, sessions, staticfiles\n  Apply all migrations: admin, sites\nSynchronizing apps without migrations:\n  Creating tables...\n    Creating table django_content_type\n    Creating table auth_permission\n    Creating table auth_group\n    Creating table auth_user\n    Creating table django_session\n    Running deferred SQL...\nRunning migrations:\n  Applying admin.0001_initial...

This is in line with the issue ticket, which suggests that the `disabled` attribute should be set to `True` to prevent accidental changes to the password field. The test initializes a `UserChangeForm` with a user instance and checks the `disabled` attribute of the password field. However, the test fails because the `disabled` attribute is not set to `True`, indicating that the current implementation does not set this attribute as expected. This failure directly relates to the reported issue, as the test is correctly checking for the presence of the `disabled` attribute, which is the core of the reported problem. Therefore, the test failure reveals the bug described in the issue ticket.", "revealing": true}}
