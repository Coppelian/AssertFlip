The issue ticket describes a problem where markers from multiple base classes are not correctly merged due to the method resolution order (MRO) in Python, which results in only one marker being present. The test code is correctly written to check for the presence of both markers, and the test error shows that only one marker ('foo') is present, which aligns with the described issue. Therefore, the test failure is indeed revealing the bug as described in the issue ticket. The test is valid as it accurately reflects the problem of missing markers when inheriting from multiple classes.", "revealing": true}}
