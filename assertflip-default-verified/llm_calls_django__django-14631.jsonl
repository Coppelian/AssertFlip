It would be better for consistency if they did, and to reduce the number of code paths.\\nOne consequence of the current code is that form._clean_fields() can return a different value from form[name].initial when they should be the same. This case is almost, but not quite, covered by \\u200btest_datetime_clean_initial_callable_disabled() (the test can be adjusted to cover this case).\\nAs part of this ticket and in line with accessing data through the BoundField objects, I noticed that the code would also be simpler if the per-field logic of changed_data() were moved into a method of the BoundField class. It could be called something like bf.did_change(). This would be more appropriate because whether form data changed for a field is a property of its BoundField (as it depends on the underlying form data), as opposed to the unbound field. With this change, the method could change from its current ~20 lines to something like this--\\n@cached_property\\ndef changed_data(self):\\n\\treturn [name for name, bf in self._bound_items() if bf._did_change()]\\nA similar change could be made to BaseForm._clean_fields().\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nHere are some snippets of possibly relevant code from the project:\n\n<CODE_SNIPPETS>\n('### django/forms/forms.py\\n...\\n379|         self.cleaned_data = {} \\n380|         # If the form is permitted to be empty, and none of the form data has \\n381|         # changed from the initial data, short circuit any validation. \\n382|         if self.empty_permitted and not self.has_changed(): \\n383|             return \\n384|  \\n385|         self._clean_fields() \\n386|         self._clean_form() \\n387|         self._post_clean() \\n388|  \\n389|     def _clean_fields(self): \\n390|         for name, field in self.fields.items(): \\n391|             if field.disabled: \\n392|                 value = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name) \\n393|             else: \\n394|                 value = self._field_data_value(field, self.add_prefix(name)) \\n395|             try: \\n396|                 if isinstance(field, FileField): \\n397|                     initial = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name) \\n398|                     value = field.clean(value, initial) \\n399|                 else: \\n400|                     value = field.clean(value) \\n401|                 self.cleaned_data[name] = value \\n402|                 if hasattr(self, \\'clean_%s\\' % name): \\n403|                     value = getattr(self, \\'clean_%s\\' % name)() \\n404|                     self.cleaned_data[name] = value \\n405|             except ValidationError as e: \\n406|                 self.add_error(name, e) \\n407|  \\n408|     def _clean_form(self): \\n409|         try: \\n410|             cleaned_data = self.clean() \\n411|         except ValidationError as e: \\n412|             self.add_error(None, e) \\n413|         else: \\n414|             if cleaned_data is not None: \\n415|                 self.cleaned_data = cleaned_data \\n416|  \\n...\\n427|         called on every field.

Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing a mismatch between `cleaned_data` and `BoundField` initial values, and incorrect entries in `changed_data`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the values are now consistent and `changed_data` is accurate.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a scenario where the inconsistency between `_clean_fields()` and `changed_data` is evident, allowing us to verify the bug's presence and ensure it is addressed in future code changes. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BaseForm._clean_fields\", \"path\": \"django/forms/forms.py\", \"line\": 389}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_LsIpS93qyluU5eGMJqkyB2cd", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BaseForm.changed_data\", \"path\": \"django/forms/forms.py\", \"line\": 438}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_bUv9sVAnU9SXyWIm7FSoEQE8", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_LsIpS93qyluU5eGMJqkyB2cd", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\nfrom django.forms.fields import FileField\nfrom django.utils.html import html_safe\n\n@html_safe\nclass BaseForm:\n    ...\n\n    def _clean_fields(self):\n        for name, field in self.fields.items():\n            if field.disabled:\n                value = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name)\n            else:\n                value = self._field_data_value(field, self.add_prefix(name))\n            try:\n                if isinstance(field, FileField):\n                    initial = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name)\n                    value = field.clean(value, initial)\n                else:\n                    value = field.clean(value)\n                self.cleaned_data[name] = value\n                if hasattr(self, 'clean_%s' % name):\n                    value = getattr(self, 'clean_%s' % name)()\n                    self.cleaned_data[name] = value\n            except ValidationError as e:\n                self.add_error(name, e)\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_bUv9sVAnU9SXyWIm7FSoEQE8", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\nfrom django.utils.functional import cached_property\nfrom django.utils.html import html_safe\n\n@html_safe\nclass BaseForm:\n    ...\n\n    @cached_property\n    def changed_data(self):\n        data = []\n        for name, field in self.fields.items():\n            data_value = self._field_data_value(field, self.add_prefix(name))\n            if not field.show_hidden_initial:\n                initial_value = self[name].initial\n            else:\n                initial_prefixed_name = self.add_initial_prefix(name)\n                hidden_widget = field.hidden_widget()\n                try:\n                    initial_value = field.to_python(self._widget_data_value(hidden_widget, initial_prefixed_name))\n                except ValidationError:\n                    data.append(name)\n                    continue\n            if field.has_changed(initial_value, data_value):\n                data.append(name)\n        return data\n```"}], "response": {"id": "chatcmpl-BrgZVBC1eK9R2UND8whGsC08PVFDz", "created": 1752134729, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "system_fingerprint": "fp_ee1d74bde0", "choices": [{"finish_reason": "stop", "index": 0, "message": {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.forms import Form, CharField\n\nclass TestForm(Form):\n    name = CharField(initial='Initial Name')\n    age = CharField(initial='Initial Age', disabled=True)\n\nclass BaseFormTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_clean_fields_vs_changed_data(self):\n        #

It would be better for consistency if they did, and to reduce the number of code paths.\\nOne consequence of the current code is that form._clean_fields() can return a different value from form[name].initial when they should be the same. This case is almost, but not quite, covered by \\u200btest_datetime_clean_initial_callable_disabled() (the test can be adjusted to cover this case).\\nAs part of this ticket and in line with accessing data through the BoundField objects, I noticed that the code would also be simpler if the per-field logic of changed_data() were moved into a method of the BoundField class. It could be called something like bf.did_change(). This would be more appropriate because whether form data changed for a field is a property of its BoundField (as it depends on the underlying form data), as opposed to the unbound field. With this change, the method could change from its current ~20 lines to something like this--\\n@cached_property\\ndef changed_data(self):\\n\\treturn [name for name, bf in self._bound_items() if bf._did_change()]\\nA similar change could be made to BaseForm._clean_fields().\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nHere are some snippets of possibly relevant code and tests from the project:\n\n<CODE_SNIPPETS>\n('### django/forms/forms.py\\n...\\n379|         self.cleaned_data = {} \\n380|         # If the form is permitted to be empty, and none of the form data has \\n381|         # changed from the initial data, short circuit any validation. \\n382|         if self.empty_permitted and not self.has_changed(): \\n383|             return \\n384|  \\n385|         self._clean_fields() \\n386|         self._clean_form() \\n387|         self._post_clean() \\n388|  \\n389|     def _clean_fields(self): \\n390|         for name, field in self.fields.items(): \\n391|             if field.disabled: \\n392|                 value = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name) \\n393|             else: \\n394|                 value = self._field_data_value(field, self.add_prefix(name)) \\n395|             try: \\n396|                 if isinstance(field, FileField): \\n397|                     initial = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name) \\n398|                     value = field.clean(value, initial) \\n399|                 else: \\n400|                     value = field.clean(value) \\n401|                 self.cleaned_data[name] = value \\n402|                 if hasattr(self, \\'clean_%s\\' % name): \\n403|                     value = getattr(self, \\'clean_%s\\' % name)() \\n404|                     self.cleaned_data[name] = value \\n405|             except ValidationError as e: \\n406|                 self.add_error(name, e) \\n407|  \\n408|     def _clean_form(self): \\n409|         try: \\n410|             cleaned_data = self.clean() \\n411|         except ValidationError as e: \\n412|             self.add_error(None, e) \\n413|         else: \\n414|             if cleaned_data is not None: \\n415|                 self.cleaned_data = cleaned_data \\n416|  \\n...\\n427|         called on every field.

Expected Outcome:\n   - The test will pass if the bug is present by showing a mismatch between `cleaned_data` and `BoundField` initial values, and incorrect entries in `changed_data`.\n   - Once the bug is fixed, the test should fail, indicating that the values are now consistent and `changed_data` is accurate.\n\n</plan>\n\nThis plan focuses on creating a scenario where the inconsistency between `_clean_fields()` and `changed_data` is evident, allowing us to verify the bug's presence and ensure it is addressed in future code changes. </PLAN> "}, {"content": "", "role": "assistant", "tool_calls": [{"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BaseForm._clean_fields\", \"path\": \"django/forms/forms.py\", \"line\": 389}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_LsIpS93qyluU5eGMJqkyB2cd", "type": "function"}, {"function": {"arguments": "{\"name\": \"BaseForm.changed_data\", \"path\": \"django/forms/forms.py\", \"line\": 438}", "name": "get_info"}, "id": "call_bUv9sVAnU9SXyWIm7FSoEQE8", "type": "function"}], "function_call": null, "annotations": []}, {"tool_call_id": "call_LsIpS93qyluU5eGMJqkyB2cd", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\nfrom django.forms.fields import FileField\nfrom django.utils.html import html_safe\n\n@html_safe\nclass BaseForm:\n    ...\n\n    def _clean_fields(self):\n        for name, field in self.fields.items():\n            if field.disabled:\n                value = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name)\n            else:\n                value = self._field_data_value(field, self.add_prefix(name))\n            try:\n                if isinstance(field, FileField):\n                    initial = self.get_initial_for_field(field, name)\n                    value = field.clean(value, initial)\n                else:\n                    value = field.clean(value)\n                self.cleaned_data[name] = value\n                if hasattr(self, 'clean_%s' % name):\n                    value = getattr(self, 'clean_%s' % name)()\n                    self.cleaned_data[name] = value\n            except ValidationError as e:\n                self.add_error(name, e)\n```"}, {"tool_call_id": "call_bUv9sVAnU9SXyWIm7FSoEQE8", "role": "tool", "name": "get_info", "content": "\"...\" below indicates omitted code.\n\n```python\nfrom django.core.exceptions import ValidationError\nfrom django.utils.functional import cached_property\nfrom django.utils.html import html_safe\n\n@html_safe\nclass BaseForm:\n    ...\n\n    @cached_property\n    def changed_data(self):\n        data = []\n        for name, field in self.fields.items():\n            data_value = self._field_data_value(field, self.add_prefix(name))\n            if not field.show_hidden_initial:\n                initial_value = self[name].initial\n            else:\n                initial_prefixed_name = self.add_initial_prefix(name)\n                hidden_widget = field.hidden_widget()\n                try:\n                    initial_value = field.to_python(self._widget_data_value(hidden_widget, initial_prefixed_name))\n                except ValidationError:\n                    data.append(name)\n                    continue\n            if field.has_changed(initial_value, data_value):\n                data.append(name)\n        return data\n```"}, {"content": "\n\n```python\nfrom django.test import SimpleTestCase\nfrom django.forms import Form, CharField\n\nclass TestForm(Form):\n    name = CharField(initial='Initial Name')\n    age = CharField(initial='Initial Age', disabled=True)\n\nclass BaseFormTest(SimpleTestCase):\n    def test_clean_fields_vs_changed_data(self):\n        #

Your goal is to write one or more test functions that reproduce and expose the reported bug.\n\nYou are given a passing test that confirms the presence of the bug. Your job is to flip the logic so the test now fails when the bug is present and passes only when the bug is fixed.\n\nFirst, carefully read the original ISSUE TICKET\n\n<ISSUE_TICKET>\n(\"BaseForm's _clean_fields() and changed_data should access values via BoundField\\nDescription\\n\\t \\n\\t\\t(last modified by Chris Jerdonek)\\n\\t \\nWhile working on #32917, I noticed that \\u200bBaseForm._clean_fields() and \\u200bBaseForm.changed_data don't currently access their values through a BoundField object. It would be better for consistency if they did, and to reduce the number of code paths.\\nOne consequence of the current code is that form._clean_fields() can return a different value from form[name].initial when they should be the same. This case is almost, but not quite, covered by \\u200btest_datetime_clean_initial_callable_disabled() (the test can be adjusted to cover this case).\\nAs part of this ticket and in line with accessing data through the BoundField objects, I noticed that the code would also be simpler if the per-field logic of changed_data() were moved into a method of the BoundField class. It could be called something like bf.did_change(). This would be more appropriate because whether form data changed for a field is a property of its BoundField (as it depends on the underlying form data), as opposed to the unbound field. With this change, the method could change from its current ~20 lines to something like this--\\n@cached_property\\ndef changed_data(self):\\n\\treturn [name for name, bf in self._bound_items() if bf._did_change()]\\nA similar change could be made to BaseForm._clean_fields().\\n\",)\n</ISSUE_TICKET>\n\nFollow these rules:\n\t1.\tOnly change what\u2019s needed.\n\t2.\tKeep the test structure exactly the same.\n\t3.\tUpdate any assertions to check for the correct behavior.\n\t4.\tRemove any comments that say the behavior is wrong.\n\t5.\tKeep it readable.
