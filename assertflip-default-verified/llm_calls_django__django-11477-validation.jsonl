The issue ticket describes a problem where the `translate_url` function creates an incorrect URL when optional named groups are missing in the URL pattern. The test code sets up a URL pattern with an optional named group `optional_param` and attempts to reverse the URL without providing this optional parameter. The expected behavior, as per the test, is that the URL should be correctly formed as '/path/' when the optional parameter is missing. However, the test error shows that the actual URL generated is '/path//', which includes an extra slash. This discrepancy indicates that the test successfully reproduces the bug described in the issue ticket. The test is valid as it directly addresses the problem stated in the issue and clearly demonstrates the incorrect behavior of the URL translation when optional parameters are not provided.", "revealing": true}}
